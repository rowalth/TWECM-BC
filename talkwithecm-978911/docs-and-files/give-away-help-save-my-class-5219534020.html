      <div><br></div><div>What you can do when:</div><ol><li>students come late</li><li>students don't show up</li><li>there is a technical problem (music/lights/etc.)</li><li>you say or do the 'wrong' thing</li><li>your partner says or does the 'wrong' thing</li><li>you feel nervous</li><li>you had a bad day</li><li>your partner had a bad day</li><li>the class is really chatty</li><li>you or your partner try to make a joke &amp; it dies &amp; stinks like a dead rabbit</li></ol><div><br><br><br>Solutions:</div><ol><li>Play music - the great cure-all! More music is a good thing. This gives people a chance to dance &amp; extra time to work on their skills. This is why they are in your class after all! Depending on the situation, you may want to suggest specific things for people to work on, or even offer some 1:1 help while the music is playing.&nbsp;</li><li>Reach out. Ask if everything is ok. Nothing worse than disappearing from a class &amp; no one even notices. It could be for personal reasons, or perhaps something happened in the class. Find out &amp; see if you can help. This not only shows that you care, but you might even get some insightful feedback for the future.&nbsp;</li><li>Delegate the task of fixing the situation (if possible) to someone else &amp; engage the class in a discussion about dancing &amp; dance related topics (a review upcoming dances &amp; workshops, for example)</li><li>(Assuming that it was unintentional) As soon as you realize what happened, own up to it. Admit that you were wrong, make it right &amp; move on. There is nothing wrong with making a mistake &amp; your honesty even help build rapport with the group. &nbsp;</li><li>Support your partner - NO MATTER WHAT! No one wants to watch a teaching team fall apart arguing in front of the class. As soon as you have the opportunity for a private conversation, (during the next song or outside of class) tell your partner what you heard. It could be a mistake, or it could be that you misunderstood the situation.</li><li>BREATHE - This is key! Holding your breath won't help. I know, I've tried it. If you can do nothing else, focus on your breathing until you are ready. Try not to fidget too much and when you speak, speak SLOWLY. You might even want to let the group know how you are feeling. There is nothing wrong with being nervous, especially if you are doing something new.&nbsp;</li><li>Focus on the moment. No matter what happened earlier in the day, you made it this far. You are in the class, alive &amp; well, so make the best of it. Communicate your needs, and ask your partner for support if appropriate. Make an effort to focus your thoughts on the present moment &amp; what is happening around you. Even if you can't shake a bad day, you might be able to take at least a short break.</li><li>Generally, it is a good idea to connect with your teaching partner before starting any class. "Checking in - Feeling ready to teach?" When your teaching partner is having a bad day, the best thing to do is offer support. This could mean, a short break, taking over the music, etc. Find ways to work together as a team, using different co-teaching models, to give the students a quality experience.</li><li>Give them something to talk about! Sometimes people just want to talk. More than likely, most of the chatting IS dance related, so silencing people could be counterproductive in the end. Try to find ways to guide the conversations. Try a round of positive feedback, offer example questions to ask a partner, etc.</li><li>Wait a beat. Some jokes take a bit longer to sink in. Look around, make eye contact. If no one laughing, give up the joke. Smile &amp; put the attention back to the group. "Tough crowd tonight!"</li></ol>
