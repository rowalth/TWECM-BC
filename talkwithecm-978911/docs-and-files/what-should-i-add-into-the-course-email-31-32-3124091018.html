      What Should I Add Into The Course? Email #31 &amp; 32

      <div><em>Note from Raelyn: I learned this idea of creating a “simple ask” from Julie Stoian’s Digital Gangsta course. The key to a successful launch for any product / service is to get people’s attention on your upcoming product / service launch or re-launch. A great way to do this is via a survey, where you ask people what THEY want in your product. In this email, you tell your subscribers about the upcoming product / service that you are planning, and then ask them for their opinions on what they want to see included in it. This does a couple of things. First, you have a better idea of what you should include in your course... so you get market research done for free. Second, people now know that you have something new coming out and will be looking out for it - especially if they have taken the time to participate in your survey.<br></em><br>Hey [first name],<br>I am launching a new product / service, [product name]. It is all about helping you to get [end result that your product brings].<br>I want to make sure that I include what YOU want in the course... so could you spare &lt; 1<br>minute to do this survey? It consists of only [# - preferably 1 to 3] short questions. [First name], what would you like to see in [Product name]?<br>Do tell me? [link to survey]<br>It won’t take you more than a minute!<br>Thank you for helping me to better understand what you need!<br>Cheers,<br>[Raelyn - add your name here] [raelyntan.com - add your URL here]<br><br><br><strong>Email #32: A Follow-up To The Simple Survey Ask</strong><br><em>Note from Raelyn: A follow-up to the previous email. The objective of this email is to show them that your product or service will be full of amazing value that (not so coincidentally) happens to contain exactly what they need! A great pre-launch email to send out to get people excited about your product or service.</em><br><strong>Subject Line: Sneak peek<br>Email Copy:<br></strong>[#] days ago, I asked you guys what you would like to see inside [Product Name].<br>Because of your feedback, we have added a couple of things into the program to make it even better than it already is.<br>Here’s a sneak peak [#] lessons we have inside [product name] that were echoed by you guys again and again!<br>All [#] items are things that many of you have said you wanted in [Product Name]. <strong>1. [Item #1 that is inside that you know people want]</strong><br>[Elaborate. Make it sound extra juicy. Was this because of what people said or was it already inside?]<br><strong>2. [Item #2 that is inside that you know people want]<br></strong>[Elaborate. Make it sound extra juicy. Was this because of what people said or was it already<br>inside?]<br><strong>3. [Item #3 that is inside that you know people want]<br></strong>[Elaborate. Make it sound extra juicy. Was this because of what people said or was it already<br>inside?]<br><strong>Get on the waiting list!</strong><br>[Product name] has been designed to [end goal], so I am so glad to have had this opportunity to improve [product name] so that it contains everything you need to [end goal].<br>[Talk about why this is so awesome and they need to get on]<br>I am launching/ relaunching [product name] next week [replace this with when your product will<br>be launched]...<br>Sign up for the waiting list [link to the waiting list] to be the FIRST to hear about it when it’s open<br>for enrollment!<br><em>Plus, there will be juicy early bird private bonuses for people who are on the waiting list too!</em><br>Cheers,<br>[Raelyn - add your name here] [raelyntan.com - add your URL here]</div>
