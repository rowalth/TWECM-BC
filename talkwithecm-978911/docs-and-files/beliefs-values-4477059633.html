      <div>American songwriter and activist Meek Mill once said, “Just build your brand from day one, man. Your brand is your name, basically. A lot of people don't know that they need to build their brand, your brand is what keeps you moving.”<br><br>And I couldn’t agree more. But what is my brand? It’s my love of lettuce, meat pie etc.) and my dislike of chocolate, croissants etc.)<br><br>My brand is the pleasure I get from books, old stamps etc.) rather than diamonds, dresses, shoes etc.)<br><br>My brand is my determination to be, and to surround myself with people who believe in integrity, equality, justice for all etc.)<br><br>My brand is my passion in helping to feeding &amp; educating children, supporting small business owners etc.&nbsp;<br><br>What is YOUR brand?<br>**<br>French poet Anatole France said, “To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.”<br><br>My big dream is change the lives of a million people struggling with anxiety etc.. But I’m determined to do that with integrity, equality, justice for all etc.)<br><br>Step one of my plan is to get over my procrastination, inner chatter, overwhelm, old belief systems etc.)<br><br>That’s easier said than done, isn’t it? How did you deal with your motivational struggles?<br>**<br>If I could only be teaching history in Scotland, Travelling with the circus etc.) I would feel as free as a bird.<br><br>No boundaries.<br>No limits.<br>No commitments.<br><br>How perfect would that be?<br><br>What would YOU do if time and money were no object?<br>**<br>If there’s one thing that makes my heart soar, it’s knowing that I can contribute towards feeding &amp; educating children, supporting small business owners etc.&nbsp;<br><br>You may underestimate your own capability to help others, but you must trust in your ability to make an impact.&nbsp;<br><br>American author Byron Katie once said, “I believe in the power of every human being to end suffering”.<br><br>I make sure to integrate this cause into my life, and if my business can allow me to make one small change, then I feel like my job is done and my life feels that much brighter.<br><br>What cause brings joy to your heart?<br><br>**<br><br>Good values are:<br><br>Uplifting.<br>Inspiring.<br>Life changing.<br><br>I believe that values are what makes life worthwhile. They bond us together in humanity, and they push us to continue to do better.<br><br>For me, a non-negotiable moral value that is part of my life code is integrity, equality, justice for all etc.) and I make sure to incorporate that in every aspect of my living, including my business.<br><br>I am convinced that your values bring a positive energy to your work, which radiates towards all those around you.<br><br>What is the core value that you choose to live by?<br>**<br>Bringing in the dollars is awesome, but what truly gives me so much joy is teaching history in Scotland, Travelling with the circus etc.)<br><br>And having MY business means that I can choose to do this, all the while maintaining my feeding &amp; educating children, supporting small business owners etc.<br><br>And this means more to me than all the riches in the world.<br><br>(well, not ALL the riches ;) )<br><br>**<br>Would you be shocked to know that I love lettuce, meat pie etc.) , but I’d do anything to avoid chocolate, croissants etc.)<br>Or to discover that I’d much rather be taking a nap, reading a book etc.) than partying till midnight, doing a backyard BBQ etc.)<br>But that’s what makes ME uniquely me.<br><br>What makes YOU uniquely you?</div>
