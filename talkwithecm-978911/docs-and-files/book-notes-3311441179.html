I felt a rush going in, not because I was nervous, but because I knew exactly what to say and do to get a job offer. Even though I never met the interviewer before, I was on familiar territory. After countless interviews, job applications and networking events, I felt prepared, alert &amp; ready.<br><br>It was like a game...after a quick assessment, I knew exactly what to say and do to pique their interest and get the job. But then, when I did get the offer...well, the rush went away. It was weird, like I was more excited about pursuing the job than actually getting it. I had had this feeling before, but I always brushed it aside. This time I couldn't just brush it aside...believe me, I tried. This time was different.&nbsp;<br><br>There was something bigger, nagging at me &amp; telling me that this job was not the right path for me.&nbsp;<br><br>Cracking the code<br><br>About a week later, a university student called me up, invited me out for coffee, asking for advice. It was amazing meeting with her, I could see so much of myself sparkling in her eyes - Big dreams, hopes and even a few fears. She was hungry to crack the code - to find the right words, the right connections, the right system to find her yes!&nbsp;<br><br>In her case, she was highly qualified, skilled &amp; talented ...but never paid. She had heaps of volunteer experience, student projects and more. But no employer wanted to be the first to hire her 'with no experience,' and yet she had SO MUCH experience! I gave her some tips about how to present herself /her experience with a few key mindset shifts and told her to keep in touch. I didn't actually expect to hear from her again, but a few weeks later, she called and told me that after three years of trying and failing she now had three exciting job offers to choose from!<br><br>This was a HUGE wake up call for me - if the system I developed for me, worked for her, could it work for others too?&nbsp; I had to find out.&nbsp;<br><br>I tested the waters, put out some information &amp; people loved it! The results were coming in and what excited me the most about this was the excitement and joy people shared with me. Telling me about the dramatic changes they were making in their own lives.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I knew that I was onto something...but I wasn't sure what. When I tried to expand my reach and connect with people who didn't already know me things got confusing - like mega confusing:<br>"Oh - so you help people get jobs, like HR specialist!"&nbsp;<br>...well, not exactly...<br>"Do you write cover letters &amp; do CV reviews?"<br>...not usually...<br>"Are you a headhunter? Host a job portal?"<br>...no...<br>"So, what exactly do you offer?"<br>Confidence!&nbsp;<br><br>"Oh, like a coach?"<br>Maybe..? I wasn't sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Branding - from the ground up<br><br>In the process of shaping my offer, I took a break and shifted my focus. I had the opportunity to dive headfirst into one of my greatest passions - Swing and blues Dancing! I used my teaching and community development skills to help build up a large scene in Vienna, Austria. Starting from small house parties in my living room to hosting the largest weekly swing dance in Austria and earning the honor of being elected as the Vice President and later on the board of our local organization - ighop, I gained first hand experience and deep insights from some great mentors about what it takes to establish and create a following around a brand.&nbsp;<br><br>Systems that work<br><br>I love working one on one with people, especially beginners, giving them the confidence to jump out on the dance floor and have a great time. Using my experience teaching refugees basic English skills - from ABC &amp; 123 - I knew exactly how to break large topics into bite sized pieces for early and continued success. In the local dance scene, I positioned myself as the beginners pal - yup a niche within a niche - and created a system to get more people out on the dance floor from day one. I shared this system with others and it really worked! As a team, we successfully welcomed adults on the dance floor who actually have two left feet!&nbsp;<br><br>I know how to make the IMPOSSIBLE - POSSIBLE!&nbsp;<br><br>With this new knowledge and experience</div><div>?????<br><br><br>AFTER - talking about the FEELING</div><ul><li>I didn't just want a fluke, or a lucky streak, I wanted a system, a framework, something that I knew I could stand on every single time....plus time, experimenting, learning, perfecting</li><li>today people are begging me to share my secrets.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br><strong>Core Values:</strong></div><ul><li>i'm a community person, I feel naked without a community, so I do appreciate having a larger network at my fingertips....especially during this past year</li><li>I think that people are people, wherever you are in the world (good ones, kind ones, selfish ones, etc, everywhere), and the cultural differences only impact the first meetings, after time, well, we can see people's true self come out</li><li>the skinniest foodie you'll ever meet</li><li>relationships are everything - communication is everything</li><li>1 - catch their eye 2 - draw them in 3 - open your magic bag of secrets!</li><li>I call BS on the 'I did it on my own' &amp; the myth of hard work</li><li>Authentic - NO FAKERS</li><li>don't tell people / show people</li><li>I am a firm believer in the power of YET</li><li>take chances / try new stuff / experiment - otherwise you'll stay stuck</li><li>all growth takes place outside the comfort zone</li><li>You don't need everyone to like you, you need the right people to like you</li></ul><div><br><strong>Expert Authority&nbsp;</strong></div><ul><li>Introvert raised by extroverts</li><li>reinvented myself in different continents / countries/ cultures / languages</li><li>Certified English teacher / examiner / judge</li><li>MBA - international business development / emarketing</li><li>Thesis - Chocopie business model</li><li>Leadership award - Taiwan</li><li>2nd Peace Oratory contest</li><li>Trained Documentary studies - How to tell a story through interviews</li><li>Every time there is a most encouraging / most enthusiastic award given - I know how to win it!
