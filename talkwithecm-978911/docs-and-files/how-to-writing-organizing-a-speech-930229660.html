      <div>Writer's’ Block: The BEAST of Writing<br><br></div><div>Whether you are preparing a presentation for work, a speech for a conference or preparing to take the IELTS exam, knowing how to organize your thoughts and create meaningful content in English can give you the edge over others when it really counts.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Almost every English exam has them - essay questions! Whether you are preparing for the IELTS, TOEFL or your English mid-term test, essay questions are something you need to face.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>When creating written content for a written exam or preparing a speech, I used to feel scared. I felt nervous. I didn’t even know where to start. What do people want to read? What will help me pass the exam? Sometimes I felt so overwhelmed, I hid behind ‘writer’s block.’&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Writer's block is the feeling that many people experience when staring at a blank page and have no idea what to write or how to proceed. I think we have all felt this way at some point or another. Writer’s block can last anywhere from a few minutes to years of struggle. If you struggle with writing, keep reading to learn my techniques for writing well under pressure.</div><div><br></div><div>Today, I will show you my proven system for overcoming writer’s block, mastering timed writing assignments and developing outstanding essays. With practice you too can move beyond writer’s block &amp; tame the wild BEAST of writing.</div><div><br></div><h1>Taking the first step</h1><div>When organizing my thoughts, I find the most helpful strategy is simply to start. That is easy to say, but not always easy to do. I try to free my thinking and begin writing without keeping so many restrictions &amp; rules in my mind. Depending on the task and time constraints, I use two different strategies:&nbsp; Free Writing and Structured Writing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br>Free Writing<br><br></div><div>When the goal is to write, to fill a page, to express an idea, concept or inner feelings, I suggest free writing. In this format, structure is secondary. Free writing allows the mind to wander and ideas to develop on a page. To use this approach, I use my 3 Step System for Free Writing.</div><div><br></div><div><br>1. Create Space<br><br></div><div>I create space by setting a timer for 10 minutes, then, no matter what happens, I keep writing! This means I keep moving my pencil across the page or my fingers tapping the keyboard, even if the thoughts seem silly or unrelated at first. For this type of writing, I don’t worry about spelling, grammar or structure at all. In fact, concerns of that nature actually distract me and impede my flow. For best results, it is sometimes helpful to look away from the paper while writing or turn off the computer screen while typing. This helps focus on the flow of writing rather than the correctness of the writing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br>2. Search for Gold<br><br></div><div>Of course the structure, grammar &amp; spelling are important in all kinds of writing. After using the free-writing technique for 10 minutes or so, I put down my pencil and look back over my writing. What is there? Which parts are useful? During this second step, I use a more critical eye to examine my writing. In this way I often find inspiring ideas that can help inspire me and break through the limitations of writer’s block. This step is much like panning for gold, I am searching amongst the rubble to find the valuable golden nuggets that can become great writing.</div><div><br></div><div><br>3. Build&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Next I create an outline to help structure my thoughts. Using a clear framework, such as an outline, helps me not only organize my writing, but also break down my writing task into small manageable chunks. I remember my knowledge of grammar, spelling and everything else that helps make written text effective. This part of the Free Writing process is very similar to my Structured Writing process.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br>Structured Writing<br><br></div><div>Not all writing can start with&nbsp; free writing - a timed test or a tight deadline, simply do not allow enough time for the luxury of a full free writing exercise first. In such circumstances, I finding starting with an outline right away helps push me though the constraints of writer’s block.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Many exam questions specify exactly what type of structure to use when answering the question. If a list of points is already provided in the question - use them! This is like getting free candy - the test writers are already giving you half of the answer. This not only saves time, but also ensures that you will answer the question more completely &amp; not miss points due to omission or skipping key details.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>When no specific structure is given, use an outline that best fits your purpose. When in doubt, I generally use a simple 5 paragraph theme outline.&nbsp;</div><div><br><br></div><div>Structured Writing - 5 Paragraph Theme Outline<br>Intro - Attention getter- Main idea sentenceBodySupporting idea 1Detail ADetail BDetail CSupporting idea 2Detail ADetail BDetail CSupporting idea 3Detail ADetail BDetail CConclusionSummary sentenceRestate the main idea in different words</div><div><br><br></div><div>The 5-paragraph theme outline is a clear format for organizing thoughts and ideas in a structured manner. Using a clear framework like this can be especially helpful when I feel nervous, stressed or unclear about where to begin.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Contrary to what most people expect, I never start with an introduction. After deciding on a clear framework for writing, such as the 5-paragraph theme outline above, I start in the middle with my 2-4 supporting ideas. What are the main points or ideas that I want to write about? In the process of thinking about the main points that I want to deliver to my audience, I fill in some supporting details to help add depth &amp; texture to my writing. After the main body of my writing is clarified, I can more easily write my main idea sentence. Depending on the topic, I sometimes find it helpful to write the conclusion before the introduction. That is, what ideas do I want the reader to have after reading my writing or listening to my speech? I write this information in the conclusion paragraph, and then work backwards making sure that every sentence in my article supports my main idea.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Working with a clear structure like this not only helps me know what to put into my writing, but it also help me keep a clear focus and know what to leave out. If something does not fit or support my main idea sentence, then I probably should not include this information in my essay.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this way, a daunting blank page can be broken down into smaller more manageable chunks of writing that are easier to create.</div><div><br></div><h1>Practice&nbsp;</h1><div>Writing well is a skill that takes time &amp; practice to develop. I suggest practicing both of these methods on a regular basis to become more comfortable with these techniques as well as writing well in English.

I woke up late, got caught in traffic, had two exams and a job interview scheduled for the same day, and to top it off - my shoelace broke! I couldn’t believe it. Seriously, it was like the universe conspired against me!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Both exams were scheduled for the morning, so I planned to use my lunch break to quickly buy new shoelaces before rushing off to my interview, but where could I grab lunch? I needed something super quick, affordable on my limited student budget, yet nourishing to give me strength to do well for my interview.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My classmate, seeing my distress, turned to me after our exam with a big smile and said, ‘Number One?’</div><div><br></div><div>YES!</div><div><br></div><div>The Number One Grill is my favorite restaurant outside the university campus, because they are cheap, fast and good.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One of my favorite things about Number One Grill is their delicious food. Every day, they offer a wide selection of food choices and display them buffet style. Besides their freshly grilled meats, prepared to perfection with their special recipe, they also offer many side dishes, including some outstanding vegetarian options. The best part is that I know I can always get my favorite grilled eggplant dish with garlic and spices.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Another great feature of the Number One Grill is that they always serve the food very quickly, even during the lunch rush. They have a clever system set up. First, all of the food is prepared in advance, presented behind a glass case and replenished fresh on demand, where each customer passes by all items available that day before placing an order. This saves time, because people usually know exactly what by the time they reach the cash register. After each order, the food is plated &amp; brought directly to the customers at their table. I really like this feature, because not only can I see the food before I order, but I can smell it too - delicious!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Number One Grill has low prices for student budgets. Despite having outstanding quality of food, they offer one of the lowest priced meals just outside the university campus. They serve large portions and no one goes away hungry. Even the hungriest students are welcome to unlimited white rice &amp; tea while eating at Number One Grill.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Whether enjoying a relaxing Tuesday afternoon in June, or rushing around with a broken shoelace, I like having a stress free lunch where I never have to worry about the quality of the food, exorbitant prices or wasting time in long lines. With affordable prices, efficient service and a variety of delicious options, Number One Grill is without question my favorite restaurant outside the university campus.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
