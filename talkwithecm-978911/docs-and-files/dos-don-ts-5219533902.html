      <div>We’ve all heard about “informational interviews” but few of us do it. What is it? How does it work? And how can you use subtle techniques to make an informational interview help you — and more importantly, the other person — even if you have seemingly little to offer?<br><br></div><div>First, an informational interview is an opportunity to meet someone you’re curious about and learn from them. Maybe you’re curious what a Product Manager really does. Maybe you want to know what the culture at IDEO is like. That’s what an informational interview allows you to do.<br><br></div><div>Next, people WANT to meet with smart people. That means you, if you send a great email, have incisive questions, and are interesting.&nbsp;<br><br>DO:</div><ul><li>R<strong>each out through a warm contact.</strong> If they didn’t have one, they spent the time to find one by studying who I know. (The info is out there, you lazy asses. Facebook, Twitter, 8 million pages I’ve written, the “Acknowledgements” page of my book. And this isn’t just about me, it’s about any busy person you want to meet.)</li><li><strong>Focus on similarities.</strong> An alum reaches out to me who seems genuine? I’ll almost always take a phone call or, if convenient, a coffee meeting. Maybe they grew up in my hometown, or went to my high school. Even I have a small semblance of emotion, leading me to occasionally act like a normal human being.</li><li><strong>They reached out with a BRIEF, CONCISE EMAIL.</strong> I will show you the exact words to use in my Dream Job course so you don’t instantly eliminate yourself.</li><li><strong>They met with me and asked very insightful questions.</strong> GOOD: I noticed you did XYZ. It’s interesting because Very-Important-Person took a different approach and did ABC. What was your thinking? BAD: I’m so unhappy at my job. What should I do with my life? Ugh. Get a bowl of soup and a therapist. That’s not the kind of question you ask at an informational interview.<ul><li>develop your questions BEFORE you go - it is fine to have a list that you refer to in your interview (This shows that you really put in the work and care about this meeting). It is not a good idea to wait until the interview to decide what and how you want to ask - the best question don't magically come when you need them. But, if they do, you can always add them to a list that you already prepared!</li></ul></li><li><strong>They asked questions for 90% of the informational interview,</strong> interjecting insightful comments once in a while, showing that they’d done their homework. In the last 10%, they mentioned what they were working on and asked for advice. When they were especially impressive/likeable, I offered to introduce them to people I know, or outright offered to hire them.</li><li><strong>They never outright asked for a job,</strong> which you never, ever do in an informational interview. They also gave me an “out” in case I couldn’t/didn’t want to help them.</li><li><strong>NOTE: These were not all the most socially smooth people.</strong> Some of them were downright socially awkward. Doesn’t matter! Sometimes, awkward can be endearing! Not everyone is Rico Suave. But the very best showed a remarkable level of preparation, which anyone can do — but few actually do.</li></ul><div>Top performers have an uncanny ability to reach extremely busy people, and they can turn a one-time meeting into a long-term relationship. And over time, that is worth more than almost any technical skill or amount of experience.<br><br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><br>DON"t<br><br><br><br><br>People do not want to meet with idiots, which includes people who…<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Ask worthless questions</strong> (“Dear Ramit, what should I do with my money?” Uh….read the last 8 years of my site?)</li><li><strong>Ramble</strong> (“Hi I’m blah blah and I’m really interested in blah blah and once when I was a kid we went to the park and blah blah and…well I guess this got really long, so…yeah. Thanks for reading.” SUICIDE IS PERMITTED FOR YOU)</li><li><strong>Only talk about themselves</strong> (Hi Mr. Senior Exec at a Fortune 100 company, let me tell you about my background, what I studied in school, what I’m interested in….” You are there to LEARN FROM THE IMPORTANT PERSON. NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOU AND YOUR STUPID INTERESTS).</li></ul><div><br><br><br>Before doing this, you should have crystal clear expectations for what a mentor will provide for you. Here are a few things to keep in mind:<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Don’t focus on getting paid.</strong> You want to optimize for learning, and make sure that the mentor knows this. If they offer to pay you for work, that’s fine, but certainly don’t ask for this up front.</li><li><strong>NEVER ask a mentor a question Google can easily answer for you.</strong> Do your homework before you ask busy people for answers. If Google could provide the answer in 20 seconds, don’t waste your mentor’s time. You want them to help you solve complex and really meaningful problems in your life instead.</li><li><strong>Put in the work up front.</strong> I always say that if you put in 10x the work that leads to 1000x the results. So don’t slack or half-ass your way through assignments or projects. Focus on becoming world class and absorbing all the knowledge you can from them.</li><li><strong>If you feel like you’re not getting a valuable experience, don’t feel like you have to keep the relationship going.</strong> Don’t just disappear and not return their calls and emails. But certainly don’t waste either of your valuable time. Communicate your feelings and move on.</li></ul><div></div>
