</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><br></div><div>Yes, If you WANT to be like kitty #B here, these 21 power words are for YOU!<br><br>[stop slides]<br>Before we even get to the list - I want to give you a context, set you up with the right mental framework - so that you can get the biggest benefits&nbsp; out of these words. Because who doesn't want benefits?? If you are ready for BIG WINS in 2021 - type big wins on the side!<br><br>It's all about:&nbsp;<br>Psychology, persuasion, relationships &amp; building trust.&nbsp;</div><div>Let's unpack that - Think of people you know, who are the people you feel drawn to, you like and trust? Have some people in mind, some specific names &amp; faces.&nbsp;<br>What about companies or brands? Are there certain brands that you trust more than others?&nbsp;<br><br>What is that? What is it about them - that draws you in, that helps you feel connected?</div><div><br></div><div>Or let’s take a look at this in a different way…imagine two different people with an ASK, maybe asking for a favor, something they want to happen / get done, at work/ at home, whatever…both good people, both have good intentions…same background / eduction / dress / nothing really that different, basically the same person and they both have an ASK....and yet - when Person A makes the ask, there is one additional word, one slight change in the way that the ask is made, Person A gets a yes &amp; gets it done, and when Person B makes the ask…the same ask, but missing that one key word - and Person B just can’t get people on board &amp; can’t get it done. ARRGGG! So frustrating! And this happens EVERY DAY &amp; people get so aggravated, angry even, especially when they are like person B &amp; they just can't figure it out, what's missing?</div><div><br></div><div>This is what I want to talk about with you, I want to look under the hood at communication, what people say and do, what highly successful business people say and do, what great leaders and influencers like Oprah say and do to help build that sense of trust and partnership instantly even with someone she just met.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But before I tell you about that - I have to clarify that This only works if you have a good product, service or offer, even something non-commercial like a quality friendship. I'm not giving you magic words to sell crap. Ok? I want to be clear about this. The goal here is to discover exactly how your idea, product or service is genuinely valuable for exact people who need it and develop your language to match the quality of your offer and basically connect the dots for others.&nbsp;<br><br>So, no magic, no who-do vodu, or anything like that, although it may FEEL like magic when you first start to use these words and understand their power, but it all has to be backed up with something real.&nbsp;<br><br>So, let's dig in to the 4 big concepts today:&nbsp;<br>BIG CONCEPTS:<br>+ This is NOT manipulation / mind control or anything creepy like that, I'm giving you the words, the tools to say what you really mean and connect with others authentically. This is for people who actually BELIEVE IN THEIR OFFER - who know it is good, who know they can &amp; want to help others...So if your looking for mind tricks to make people do things they DON'T WANT TO DO - sorry, you won't find that here.&nbsp;<br>+Questions - I love this one! It is so simple...and so clever. Simply by understanding how questions work - you can change the direction a conversation is going.&nbsp;<br>You've probably already heard of open &amp; closed questions, right? And there is a 3 type of question that is even MORE powerful when used in the right way - unfinished questions.&nbsp;<br>Let's unpack that.<br>Open vs. closed questions / unfinished questions- Yes/NO vs WH questions&nbsp;<br>Do you like living in Chicago?&nbsp;<br>What's it like living in Chicago?<br><br>Are you angry?<br>Why are you so angry?<br>When the boss called you out at the meeting, you felt...?<br><br></div><div>+People don't care about what you are doing...they care about WHY you are doing it. From big offers - apple products -think different-&nbsp; to simply giving a small 20% discount, people want to know why? Why are you doing that? Is there something wrong with the product? Is no one buying it?&nbsp;<br>When we listen, our brains are wired to look for the why &amp; when we talk, we focus almost exclusively on the WHAT - what I'm offering, what I'm doing, what the price is, what discount is...so take a moment and think about that when you are talking, presenting, writing - even in one-way communication, address the WHY question, so that people don't have to go looking around in dark corners for the answer.&nbsp;<br><br>How's that for a big light bulb! MIND BLOWN!<br><br>+ People want to be heard / understood...this is where the connection comes in - relationships are everything - at work, at home, with friends...especially this year - people want to feel heard.&nbsp;<br><br></div><h1>“I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”</h1><div><br>― <strong>Maya Angelou</strong></div><div><br>Side note: If you want money, ask for advice! (If you want advice, ask for money! hahaha)<br><br>BIG Mind blown moment anyone? What's your big takeaway? What did you hear that you don't want to forget? Type that on the side, let me know.&nbsp;<br>These are huge!<br><br>So, now i've given you the 4 key principles that the 21 Power words for 2021 are based on, and you can start using them right away, in conversations, online meetings, email, website copy, social media posts - all of it!&nbsp; Whenever you're communicating I want you to think about:<br>+being authentic - 100% YOU, no fake smiles or lame scripts,&nbsp; they feel gross &amp; they don't work anyway<br>+closed / open / unfinished questions<br>+keep your focus on the WHY behind your what<br>+People will never forget how you made them feel.&nbsp;<br><br>If you haven't already, go ahead like this page, set an alarm &amp; come back tomorrow for the 21 Power words you want to use in 2021 - so that you can effortlessly attract attention, wow your audience and kick imposter syndrome to the curb!<br><br>SEE YOU TOMORROW!</div><div><br>Getting to YES</div><ol><li>‘A good fit’ - more than just great, it is specifically for YOU / HERE / NOW - strengths = needs<ol><li>fits the hole in their life “safety features, for example…a problem they didn’t know they had, but now prioritize!&nbsp;</li><li>Job application - Why are you a good fit for our company? Not just skills/traits, but how you specifically match their exact need now/ in the future</li></ol></li><li>Unbelievable! (Surprise, see it to believable)&nbsp;<ol><li>blanket adjectives - develop a strong science of interest…what makes it unbelievable?? Pull people in</li><li>It sounds surprising, amazing, shocking…tickles their curiosity!&nbsp; Makes them want to ’solve that mystery’ trigger the BIG why - an intriguing mystery - why is it unbelievable?&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Quick &amp; easy - a done for you solution, take this problem away from me, if I have a BIG / annoying problem &amp; you have the solution, I’ll pay anything. Bushra - creates of the Mass Persuasion Method says it this way - are you trying to solve the problem of a butt pimple or an UTI, if I have a UTI &amp; you have a quick and easy solution for me, I will throw my money at you - just take it!&nbsp;</li><li>Tested &amp; proven, research driven = OMGoodness - this one used a lot because it works - adds credibility to what you are doing…PLUS by backing up your statements with science, and doing the work, you can make analyzing the data &amp; all of the research quick &amp; easy for others - YOU make it accessible!&nbsp;</li><li>Scarcity - this one is a bit different, this is more of a concept of rarity &amp; value<ol><li>Exclusive, limited time</li><li>&nbsp;which can lead to a more Impulsive YES…not to miss the opportunity</li><li>never underestimate the FOMO factor! (Fear of Missing Out)</li></ol></li><li>No questions asked - guarantee! This one might not apply to every situation as easily as the others, but any time you are creating an OFFER - remember this approach any time you want to lower the barriers to a YES<ol><li>Offer could be a product or service / a job trial / I even heard of someone offering this to get a date! Seriously!</li><li>Main goal here is to really Stand behind your offer / idea - if you believe in it, stand behind it</li><li>Take away the risk for others</li></ol></li><li>Get it TODAY - Instant access<ol><li>ooooh yes! Instant gratification!! I can hear the angels singing!</li><li>Immediacy, rewards sooner</li><li>Instant gratification - people want it and</li><li>&nbsp;Avoid over deliberation - putting it off until later...ummm NO</li></ol></li><li>YOU - NAME - People pay attention, feel connected, wonder if you already know each other…EVEN name tags work!! This is a super easy one to try out - next time your in a coffee shop / supermarket -fighting over toilet paper / any store or shop really - try it &amp; watch how differently people respond.&nbsp;</li><li>FREE, people love free stuff…I know it sounds cheesy, but it is oh so true. And I"m not just talking about lame-o free stuff either. Let me give you an example I like to call the Truffle Shuffle: Experiment - real experiment with real people: 2 products a truffle and a Hershey kiss. Now, I'm from PA...and I have a soft spot for Hershey...but I have some truths to lay down today.<ol><li>Trial one: 15 vs 1 c&nbsp; - MOST people take the truffle! 15c truffle, are you kidding me?</li><li>&nbsp;Trial two: 14c vs free - KISSES WIN</li><li>Crazy right, the price difference is the same, the value difference the same, but the outcomes were tremendously different. People will make different choices based simply on this one word.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Because - there is something magical about this word. It’s been tested &amp; retested, in different times &amp; situations, and the results pretty much always the same. People believe that the reason given after the word because justifies whatever came previously. Let me give you can example - there was a study, with a copy machine. People were cutting in line. “Can I cut in line? I only have 3 pages.” 60%, Next time “I only have 3 pages, can I cut in line BECAUSE I’m in a rush.” 95% WHAT?!?!? give a reason, even a lame one will statistically improve your results</li></ol><div>Creating the right atmosphere - especially in tense negotiations</div><ol><li>&nbsp;Please &amp; thank you - 1000% shows respect for everyone involved. // you would do the same for me - reciprocity - ....vs thank you.</li><li>Request - may I make a request, I have a request…people can agree to that. // May I? May I say something? May I make a request?&nbsp;</li><li>Suggestion - May I make a suggestion? No commitment involved. This is NOT a demand</li><li>Let’s process this together - pulling someone in, get a fresh breath of air…stop the argument&nbsp;</li><li>Let me get back to you. GIVES you time to think clearly &amp; make a thought through decision.&nbsp;</li><li>Unpack - this for me, explain things more clearly&nbsp;</li><li>Choose - the choice is yours, 2-3 choices = things get done, you can do it on your own, do nothing, allow me to guide you. Make the decision clearer for others - map out the options for them so they can actually see the best fit.</li><li>Partnership - people respond to this, not adversary…not successive one night stands, but partnerships that enable all involved to develop something greater. If you are selling products…sales, sales, sales, wham, bam, thanks…&amp; always on the hunt for new customers…but on the other hand, focusing on relationships, developing relationships &amp; partnerships over time gives you the opportunity to do so much more! Partners want both sides to win!</li><li>Discover - discovery phase - gathering information, needs analysis, time / resources, understanding each other, what are the values &amp; priorities involved in a negotiation Explore - brainstorming ideas…what would that feel like? What if…?</li><li>Have you ever made an exception? (At the gatekeeper, trying to follow the rules) Would it be possible to make one exception this time?</li><li>What do you know about…” They reveal either their desire to learn more or the gaps or misinformation they are basing decisions on…this can bring them from certainty to doubt, making them more open to conversation&nbsp;</li></ol><div>Job Interviews:<br>+</div><ol><li>So, obviously, I’d love to get the job…but when you are thinking down the line, after you hire me or someone else, how will you know a year from that you’ve made the right choice? What will that person have to have done to have been an excellent hire? - people love this question, let’s the other person know that you really want to know what it takes to be good, and second you give them the space to look at you &amp; imagine the ‘perfect fit’ - VERY POWERFUL</li><li><em>Do you have any other questions? </em>no…assume that they have questions…lurking deep in their mind. Change to What other questions do you have? Or better yet, KILLER QUESTION: Based on our conversation, is there anything leaving you with hesitancy for hiring me for this position? - Cass Thompson<br>Shows you can take feedback<br>&nbsp;Gives opportunity to fight for it,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;You’ll know where you stand &amp; is a sure check for open questions at the end<br><br><br></li><li>(Stuck At a standstill) - If I were in your position, I would feel the same way….reasons…[validating the person // adding empathy] loosen the tense situation, ‘ all of that said, …’ then give the reasons &amp; justifications for your position.&nbsp;</li><li>The yes ladder…you’ve probably heard this, experienced it &amp; perhaps can even smell it when you pick up a call from a telemarketer…but what about elsewhere? A date?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;have you ever heard of swing dancing…ever thought about trying it…would you like to go with me sometime….how about next Saturday, date/time</li><li>I’m not sure if this is for you but… - sales technique called the ‘takeaway’ - you take the pressure off, and sparks the listeners curiosity, listening more with out being defensive &nbsp;</li><li>How open minded are you? (Most people do want to be open minded, at least about somethings…improving their life, health, finances, etc.)</li><li>How would you feel if…” - gets excited about the future - imagine ideal vacation experience &amp; describe it to your partner (use contrast here, two extremes, ultimate dream vaca vs. never being able to make that trip of our dreams (health, finances, age) <strong>Fear of loss is more powerful than the hope for gain.</strong></li><li>Imagine this - just imagine - in order to make any decision- it must be first made in your mind. Before you say yes to a new apartment or house you first imagine what it would be like, living there, working there…in your mind. Just imagine how this could benefit your family… contrast works well here - extremes&nbsp;</li><li>When would be a good time? Or When? Get a specific clear date/time</li><li>If /then sandwich phrase, if you take care of your life insurance now, then you &amp; your family will have the coverage &amp; peace of mind that you deserve.&nbsp;</li><li>Most people…XYZ, you can be a conversational Shepard….most people in your situation do this, or choose option B</li><li>The good news….positive words, brings positive energy into the conversation - potty training, the good news is that older sibs / mama &amp; papa struggled with it too, but with time and focus your child will learn too!&nbsp;</li></ol><div><br></div><div></div>
