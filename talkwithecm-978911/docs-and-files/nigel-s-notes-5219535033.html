Bedtime around 8, Days off, after breakfast, outdoor activity, hiking or swimming with one child, back for chores or building ( new home )&nbsp; later <br>----both Professionals haveBreakfast together with family ( as against, or as well as, dinner )<br><br><strong>2 Is this what you want ? whats your dream-</strong><br> <strong>Thomas</strong>, September 3 month paternity leave Then a new project... Like variety- <br><strong>Christine</strong>, ideal world - 30-32 hour week. in a consuting role. more in charge of time<br><br><strong>3 Motivations...</strong><br><strong>Christine</strong> - tradeoffs, I had to reduce volunteering roles. I read over 100 books a year, making time for them. I Tetrus my time.... Super into efficiency, let go of stuff- I have let go of perfectionism, ie the perfectly clean floor.... <br><strong>Thomas</strong> - Would I go from part time to full time. I came up with 10 - 15 reasons to go full time again. Money one. as expert i can be part time, as a leader not. )50% employee still does 80% of the work I feelBrain said go full time. gut said I like that&nbsp; my life has slowed down again , I am in the life. Like 3 days high speed, and switch to 4 days something else altogether. In the 4 days off I regenerate. friends with neighbours, feeling of the seasons passing.&nbsp; ( comment - colleagues part time to full time the extra money gets taken by taxation ! )<br> <br>4.<strong>Thomas</strong>&nbsp; compared savngs with a friend on lower pay. savings were same. costs of working are higher. ( Book the cost of living ? )<br><br><strong>5 Help and support?</strong><br> <strong>Christine</strong>- third time back full time. as ex pats both fulltime, abroad, Husband has a fixed 9-6 role. we run with 2 babysitters. cos of 2 different kindergarten/schools. ( have worked out a way that the girl friday can do reduce this to one )The girlf friday is really good, ie spotting that school stops early. Last time full time was a nightmare running around15 euro per hour, house mgt - 10 hrs, for the was a babysitter first.<br><strong>Thomas</strong> - currently Salary based maternity model, Hannah on maternity, baby is 7 months. Grandparents will help out&nbsp; one day a week on return.intergenerational link, if the grandparents couldnt help, it might not work ( for another family )Variety is good, coming home to a full diaper is fun !Even if one partner earns twice as much, there is stll not an argument against sharing the home work from financial basis. partly cos of austrian labour tax<br><br><strong>.6 &amp; 7 Takeaways and telling younger self</strong><br><strong>Christine</strong>- I dont have to be a superwoman/mum. embrace the imperfections of life. Accepting help . being really intentional about what i do do. ( &amp; dont do )&nbsp; Running is really important. solve the problem by putting it in the middle of my day. 5 to 10 minutes hanging in bed with the kids is OK! <br><strong>Thomas</strong> -about my project- tell my younger self. scrap life goals. experiment. try stuff. focus less on becoming somebody, and more on finding what you really are. I had linear goals and kept asking " what next" a lot of personal wealth comes from available timemy project - I thank my son - i was always on all in/ overtime etc. with a child and part time, you can ask for what you want far more. I didnt know about the option, but when i tried it it was so obvious. everyone should have this option. all people should take a step back and see if its the amount i want to do .... I find I am more invilved no both at home and work , then 10-15 years befoe, because i get the chance to regenerate at home so am more productive at workothers said "I like to work full time" ( but actually its ingrained in culture and colleagues hadnt thought of any alternatives ) experiemnt with perhaps 5 hours less a week. wahlzeit project. encouraging people to experience value of time.an abundance of time, rather than a scarcity of time.<br><strong>Christine</strong>- important to have more choice over how and when i spend my time , the feeling is incredibly helpful. I feel i have the time to do the things that are imoportant for my family. - parents evening, brownies, - technology allows home access... ) <br><br>adjourned to absolutely excellent BUN Beefand conversations unrecorded....and on way out discovered <a href="https://www.wokip.at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.wokip.at/</a>at baomio on Friday mornings :-)&nbsp;</div>
