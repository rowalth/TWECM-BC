Everyone is looking for quick answers to shift their offline activities online without investing time they don't have to learn everything from scratch and without coming across as salesy or like a complete scam.&nbsp; <br><br>I get it. You may not know this about me, but I struggled hard with the same quest a few years ago, when I first started down the path to shift my offline business online. <br><br>I had no idea how to behave online, and I assumed that my offline skills would not translate. So I set aside everything that I knew, listened to 'expert' advice and started chasing after false targets.<br><br>FLOP #1: <strong>Create content - a lot of content</strong><br>At the start I created tons of content, articles, posts, videos, tweets, that people just scrolled on by. I fumbled awkwardly with my words trying to grab attention and convince people to buy. But the only thing I managed to do was create more content that no one cared about.<br><br><strong>Create scarcity </strong><br>I threw around phrases like,<strong> Last chance! Buy now! Hurry!</strong> and it made me want to puke in my purse.<br><br><strong>Use social media</strong><br>LinkedIn, Blab, Twitter, Instagram, Twitch, Snapchat...I tried it all and tested different hacks and gimmicks, but no one was impressed. I felt like my efforts were a waste of time and I couldn't even attract a decent troll. <br><br>Nothing gave me the real connections to the people who actually want what I'm offering. <br><br><strong>Contests - Prizes</strong><br>Once I even I bought prizes thinking that a giveaway would be THE way to explode my contact list, and it was fun, until it didn't work - AT ALL. I got two email addresses - TWO. I felt totally stupid awarding 1st &amp; 2nd prize with confetti, and third prize was never claimed. <br><br>It was so frustrating. I knew something was missing, but I couldn't figure out what it was.<br><br>I could see others succeeding. I saw other businesses making big money with cheap looking websites and products that didn't offer half the value of what I was giving away for free. What secret sauce were they using? What did they know that I didn't?<br><br>A few times I came very close to giving up - because the idea of me having a thriving online business seemed as realistic as a cat opening a scuba school. <br><a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTYDtFaYQdmT37gCsZqQDcsU_qUmacxj1tkhmjArVzTOF7aexKf&amp;usqp=CAU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTYDtFaYQdmT37gCsZqQDcsU_qUmacxj1tkhmjArVzTOF7aexKf&amp;usqp=CAU</a><br><br>Would <em>you</em> pay this cat to teach you to dive?<br><br><strong>The good news</strong> is that I <strong>didn't </strong>give up.&nbsp;<br><br>After studying, testing, and improving for years, I identified a few simple beliefs holding me back… and some key insights that completely shifted my focus and changed how I approach people and start conversations online, people I already know and people I've just met.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The point is, I slowly and painfully crawled out of it — and now I'm continually expanding and growing my online business - yes, even during the pandemic! Offers, email addresses, clients, income? yes - all of it! <br><br><strong>The bad news</strong> is that there is no funnel, no strategy, no sales video, no ad campaign, no hack or gimmick - nothing is going to replace the key deciding factor that makes a person ultimately say yes or no. I am talking about the human element - conversations and personal relationships. Whether it is reading a personal story, getting a referral from a friend, public reviews, testimonials or even talking to a sales rep, most people won't even <strong>think </strong>about getting out their wallet without some form of personal contact. <br><br>So everything that I thought was no longer relevant &amp; was about to flush down the toilet, suddenly became my main focus. Personal connections and meaningful conversations. <br><br>Think about that - putting yourself forward and creating meaningful contact points are a vital part of doing business online, and the current pandemic only amplifies that even more! <br><br>Right now many people feel stuck, frustrated and are sick of feeling overlooked. People crave connection now more than ever before. <br><br><br><strong>So, if you are looking to stand out from the crowd, create trust and let people see your true value - it is time to take a serious look at how you are building relationships online. <br><br><br>Relationships are the single greatest competitive advantage that you can get. <br></strong><br>So, what is your <strong>core message</strong>? This is your foundation and will determine what your path to success will look like. Is it going to be a long track up to the peak of a mountain, an uphill battle in the snow, sleet and rain? Or will it be more like a walk down to the beach, listening to your favorite tunes along the way?<br><br>Sometimes it really is as simple as that. Are people responding to your message with likes, comments, shares, screaming "YES - I need this!" and throwing their wallets at you? Or are you staring at an empty bank account and wondering why people just aren't responding?&nbsp;<br><br>If you are offering something people don't need....it's hard! You'll spend way to much time trying to convince people, begging people to just try your product. No one wants to do that.&nbsp;<br><br>But if you are offering something of real value and can help people solve a problem, get rid of a pain, eliminate a nagging frustration once and for all - your path to success will look more like this: beach<br><br></div><div><strong>Act now and gain in 4 weeks what took me over 15 years, 3 continents, trial and a lot of errors to learn.
