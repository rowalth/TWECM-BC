I really appreciated the opportunity to meet together face to face and hear some of your ideas about how we want to shape this group and move forward. <br><br>I'm writing this email to sum up what happened and give clear steps for what's next.<br><br><strong>What happened?</strong><br>The VFN Professionals KICKOFF Meeting, our first meeting, was held on Wednesday, August 29, 2018. We started things in a relaxed way at 18:30 in an inner courtyard with lots of plants and a mini water fountain off to the side. We got to know each other with a meet &amp; greet gathering and some Bingo fun. At 19:00 we moved inside to the colorful meeting room for the more formal portion of the evening. Here, we addressed the questions:</div><ul><li>Who are we?</li></ul><div>We each introduced ourselves and Roman shared a personal story.</div><ul><li>What do we want to do?</li></ul><div>Elizabeth briefly described her vision for VFN Professionals followed by a group brainstorming session. We asked the question: How do we want our meetings to look like? What do we want from this group?<br><br>We ended the evening with a community dinner at a nearby Asian noodle restaurant. I love eating international food with an international crowd! (Sorry, no photos.)<br><br><strong>What about the prizes?</strong><br>Of course, I can't forget to mention our prize winners! Congratulations to our Bingo winners: Angela, Sophie &amp; Oana, and our brainstorming team winners - with 22 ideas!<br><br><strong>A great big 'YES!'</strong><br>Personally speaking, this meeting was a huge affirmation, a great big 'YES!' that we are moving and growing in a way that matters to you, our members.

In fact, without this organisation there would be no VFN Professionals! <br><br>Last, but certainly not least, we want to thank you - the members of VFN Professionals. During the meeting, we took a moment to look around and see the real faces of VFN Professionals. This was a powerful moment. As a group we represent many nations, cultures and industries. We are freelancers, employees, CEOs, business owners and more. We are parents who want to make the best life that we can for our children. We bring a wide range of knowledge and experience to the group. Celebrating the unity in our diversity, we thank you for believing in us. <br><br><strong>So, what's next?</strong><br>Now that you have a better idea about who we are &amp; what we want to do as VFN Professionals, take a moment to invite other VFN members to join you in this group with a message like this:<br>‚ùù<em>Have you heard about VFN Professionals?

The space was open and comfortable with sofas for lounging and lots of plants. <br><br>We also want to thank <a href="http://www.soba.wien" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Soba Noodles </a>for working together with our time schedule and giving us a welcoming space for our community dinner. I always love eating international food with an international crowd.<br><br>Next we want to thank the <a href="https://viennafamilynetwork.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VFN</a>, no only for helping us as parents, but for giving us the platform to meet together and create something new as professionals. In fact, without this organisation there would be no VFN Professionals!&nbsp;<br><br>Last, but certainly not least, we want to thank you - the members of VFN Professionals. During the meeting, we took a moment to look around and see the real faces of VFN Professionals. This was a powerful moment. As a group we represent many nations, cultures and industries. We are freelancers, employees, CEOs, business owners and more. We are parents who want to make the best life that we can for our children. We bring a wide range of knowledge and experience to the group. Celebrating the unity in our diversity, we thank you for believing in us.&nbsp;</div>
