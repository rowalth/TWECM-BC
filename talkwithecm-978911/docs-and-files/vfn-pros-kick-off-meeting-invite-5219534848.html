      <div>Eventbright.at<br><br>Hello &lt;name&gt;,<br><br>I'm thrilled to announce that it is time for our first VFN Professionals meeting! <br><br>Like other VFN meetings, this is a great opportunity for you to see familiar faces, meet new friends and get inspired by stories of other members. You can also meet and share your ideas with the organisers behind VFN Professionals: Elizabeth &amp; Roman. <br><br>This meeting is for all VFN Professionals.<br><br>Date: Wednesday, August 29<br><br>Location: Rechte Wienzeile 37<br><br>Program:<br>18:30 - Meet &amp; greet with light refreshments at MUT <a href="https://www.verein-mut.eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.verein-mut.eu</a><br>19:00-19:30 - Interactive presentation about VFN Professionals - Who We Are &amp; What We Want To Do<br>20:00 - Community Dinner at Soba Noodle Bar <a href="http://www.soba.wien/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">www.soba.wien</a><br><br>How to join:<br>Please register here tk-link<br>The event is free, but we do ask that you bring a donation with you (5-10 euros as you are able) to help cover our organisational costs (including location &amp; refreshments).<br><br>FAQ:<br><br>1. Who is invited? Is this just for women? Should I bring my family? Will there be a babysitter there?</div><div>This group is for professionals with families. We understand that you have little ones to think about. For this meeting we have not organised any type of childcare. This could be a space, for those who want it, to practice combining family and professionalism. Do you have a 4 month old who will sleep in a pram or a 2 year old who will be pulling on your leg and crying because it is late? Maybe you have a 10 year old who will happily read a book by your side. You know yourself and your family best. Is it better for you to come alone or with your family? We want you to chose.<br><br>2. My neighbour really wants to come, can I just bring her?<br>No. This meeting is for VFN Professionals members ONLY. If your neighbour is a VFN member, but not yet a VFN Professionals member it is easy to join: tk-link<br><br></div><div>2. My daughter doesn't go to sleep until 19:30, can I just come to the dinner?<br>Yes! This event is set up to be modular so that you can pick and chose when you want to come and which part you want to attend. Whatever you chose, please be sure to sign up here tk-link so we can be prepared for you.<br><br>3. Is dinner included?<br>No, we ask that you pay for your own dinner. &nbsp;<br><br>4. A donation? I thought all VFN events are free.<br>Actually, not all VFN events are free. Because we are already such a large group (88 confirmed members!), we tried to find an affordable space where we can meet. If you have other ideas for future meetings, we'd love to hear it.<br><br>5. Sounds like a boring business meeting, why should I come to the presentation?<br>Actually, this will be an interactive presentation designed to add value to your life. Oh, and there will be prizes :)<br><br>6. I am new to Vienna and I feel shy about meeting new people. Do I have to share my story or make a presentation at the meeting?<br>No, no one is forced to do anything. Feel free to come and participate in whatever way feels best for you. If you wish to sit back and watch without saying a word to anyone, welcome! If you prefer to use this as a networking opportunity, to find like-minded people, that's great too.&nbsp;</div>
