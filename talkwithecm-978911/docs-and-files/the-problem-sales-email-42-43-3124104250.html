      <div><strong>Email #42: The Problem Awareness Email</strong></div><div><br></div><div><em>Note from Raelyn: This email is targeted at colder subscribers who are at an earlier stage of the buying journey. These are people who may not even be aware of the problem that your product can help them to solve yet. Typically this is sent BEFORE the launch... way before any of the other sales emails you see here.</em></div><div><br></div><div><em>For instance, you may have a course that teaches people how to use Excel. However, a certain percentage of your subscribers may not even be aware that they need any help with Excel. For instance, if your product/service is positioned to help people multiply their productivity by becoming a pro in Excel shortcuts, some of your subscribers may not have identified Excel as THE bottleneck that is impeding their productivity, nor realize that they need Excel help.</em></div><div><br></div><div><em>This email helps to get them aware of whatever problem you are helping them to solve. Some ideas, depending on your niche:</em></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>●&nbsp; <em>Talk about the benefits of mastering / accomplishing whatever you are teaching</em></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>●&nbsp; <em>Talk about the importance</em></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>●&nbsp; <em>Talk about why they shouldn’t delay this any longer</em></div><div><br></div><div>●&nbsp; <em>Talk about why their life is bad now because they haven’t mastered whatever you are teaching</em></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>●&nbsp; <em>Talk about how their life will radically change when they take whatever you teach seriously.</em></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Subject Line: Why mastering [topic] is absolutely essential</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Email Copy:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Hey [first name],</div><div>As you know, I am an [topic] teacher and I help [target audience] to [end goal] with [product name].</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Do you...</strong></div><div>●&nbsp; [Talk about the problems they face right now so that your subscribers can realize that they have a problem you can solve]</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>●&nbsp; [Talk about the problems they face right now so that your subscribers can realize that they have a problem you can solve]</div><div><br></div><div>●&nbsp; [Talk about the problems they face right now so that your subscribers can realize that they have a problem you can solve]</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Over the years, I’ve interacted with ~[#] number of people who have received help with [topic] and this is how their life has changed:</strong></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>●&nbsp; [Talk about the benefits / end result of solving the problem that you will help them solve]</div><div><br></div><div>●&nbsp; [Talk about the benefits / end result of solving the problem that you will help them solve]</div><div><br></div><div>●&nbsp; [Talk about the benefits / end result of solving the problem that you will help them solve]</div><div><br></div><div><em>I know what you may also be wondering.

This will cause them to feel the “pain” more acutely / have a stronger desire for what you sell... such that they are willing to pay for it. The truth is that many of us have many problems in our lives that we want to change. We also have many desires and things that we want. But we are NOT buying every single thing that we see, right? You need to agitate a problem before people can get to the point where they want a solution NOW.</em></div><div><em><br>At times, people would already be looking for a solution and agitating their problem is not needed, but for most people, we don’t wake up looking to buy specific things.</em></div><div><em><br>... and all these happen even before you talk about your solution!
