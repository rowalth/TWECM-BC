      <div>Hi Elizabeth here!<br><br>Working from home survival guide<br><br>Let's share this with others - real value - set up a watch party!<br><br>First who's here? Where are you listening in from?<br>World / district<br>Vienna - chancellor sebastian kurs - marathon, not a sprint -&nbsp;<br>so I decided I really want to share this with you - for free - not taking email addresses, no trials, JUST FREE, because I am convinced it is going to help you.<br><br><br>SLIDE<br>Professionals with kids - at HOME!?!<br><br>SLIDE<br>What the WHAT??</div><div><br>1. Most of us thought balancing career &amp; family life was challenging before all this corona-crisis started. Remember that? seems like a cake walk now<br><br></div><div>Most of us have tested, developed and well, tried to do everything in our power to create a sustainable situation - professional / social / partner / parent (which is impressive in itself!),&nbsp;<br><br>but now everyone - every single person is suddenly thrust into a completely new (&amp; unplanned for) situation...and all of the things that we usually depend on for support (reliable childcare, self care, exercise/meditation class, time ALONE, etc. etc.) have all been taken away.&nbsp;<br><br>Raise your hand if going to the bathroom in private sounds like total luxury right now!<br><br>Listen it's important that we acknowledge the strain all of this puts on everything - work, family, us as parents &amp; our children - and we all need the room to be frustrated and inefficient.</div><div><br></div><div>We really are in uncharted waters.&nbsp;<br><br>And rather than give a check list of must do's I'd rather guide us all towards a&nbsp;<br><br>"What can I let go of - list"&nbsp;<br><br>or as my friend Charlotta put it - my DON'T DO list!&nbsp;<br>So rather than make a list of all the magic ways your family is going to&nbsp;</div><ul><li>juggle work responsibilities</li><li>tackle financial struggles</li><li>create healthy instagram worthy meals</li><li>design your own family fitness workout</li><li>re-organize your home</li><li>create all those photo albums you've been putting off</li><li>flying to the moon</li></ul><div>Think of all the things you can say 'no' to - your Don't Do List.&nbsp;<br><br>go ahead - put it next to your other to-do lists, if you're that kind of a person, or simply post it on your wall - if you are stuck at home like me! Right there on the wall where I'll see it every day!</div><div><br>And now I'd like to dig a little deeper &amp; give you my working from home survival kit&nbsp;<br><br>SLIDE<br>A.&nbsp;<br>Manage expectations (yours, your boss, coworkers, your family) Everyone knows that things are different, but we don’t have a common understanding of HOW they are different - talk about it as soon and as often as possible.</div><div><br></div><div>SLIDE<br>B.&nbsp;<br>Be gentle with yourself and others. For the most part we are all adjusting to change &amp; doing what we think is best to cope (except for a few stinkers). Kids screaming? Regressing? Yup. Political rantings? Spreading woo-hoo corona-prevention tips - garlic??Sigh, yeah... they are all trying to do something - anything - in this time of helplessness.&nbsp; Coping. So be as gentle and understanding as possible during this time of transition - for everyone.&nbsp;<br><br>So, remember those expectations we talked about in tip 1? yeah, be gentle about those too, just because you agreed on and fixed a schedule in week 1 does NOT mean it is going to work in week 2!</div><div><br>SLIDE<br>C.&nbsp;<br>Breathe - for real. Set boundaries and take care of yourself. Don't forget the basics - because this is what we all really need: Eat well, sleep well &amp; shake your butt!<br><br>I'll give you some clear areas to focus on here:<br>SLIDE</div><ol><li>Get dressed. The novelty of working in your PJs wears off.&nbsp; - this is so true. Not, I"m not saying that you have to dress the same as you would to go to the office...in fact it doesn't really matter what you wear, but do get yourself up &amp; ready for the day - the same as you would if you were actually going to work. Maintain that rhythm - spending the time to physically &amp; - now this is key - MENTALLY get ready.&nbsp;<ol><li>wait! I have 3 kids under 5! Right - I'm not saying this is going to be a piece of cake, or even that you have to nail it every day, but it is an important piece in the puzzle.</li></ol></li></ol><div>SLIDE</div><ol><li>Find a space that can be your "office" -- working from bed or the couch may be tempting, especially as you think, 'Yeah, I can keep one eye on the kids..." but it probably won't work out exactly as you hoped - in fact, it probably won't work for you or them. Think about constant interruptions, pulling on your leg &amp; all the rest. Having a dedicated "do not disturb" space will allow you to "leave" work when your workday is done.&nbsp;<ol><li>WAIT! My space is the size of a postage stamp...right, if you don't have a door to shut, or a curtain to slide across, find some kind of a sign or symbol to make clear boundaries for children between work and family time. Wearing a fancy hat or blue scarf, or turn on a special teddybear light for example.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><div>SLIDE</div><ol><li>Keep your routine. We've all hear this one a lot. ROUTINE, ROUTINE, ROUTINE. It seems like the magic cure-all from everything from sleep regressions to potty training...so of course we have to talk about it again now. So, a few tips:<ol><li>Handle this like any work project - create a schedule, plan it out as a family - I mean with your new "co-workers" &amp; stick to it. Strive to make and maintain as regular of a routine as you can - listen,&nbsp; kindergartens do it, schools do it...&amp; you can too! It helps every one have a clear idea of what's expected and how to help. Even if you are NOT a routine person...try it for a week &amp; let me know how it works. &nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><div>SLIDE</div><ol><li>Leave the house. At least once a day make sure you take a walk or run an errand or something to get outside - even if it is just to stick your head out the window &amp; scream - do it. The sunshine &amp; fresh air helps - just remember to stick to all of the most up to date social distancing rules &amp; guidelines.&nbsp;</li></ol><div>SLIDE<br>Physically we are all isolated right now &amp; you might feel totally alone - despite the little ones hanging off of you like costume jewellery, but the truth is that we are all in this together.<br><br>Let's be kind to one another.&nbsp;<br><br>GOAL: physically distant and Socially connected.&nbsp;<br><br>Like it, love it? let me know<br>What's your take away, I'd like to know.&nbsp;</div>
