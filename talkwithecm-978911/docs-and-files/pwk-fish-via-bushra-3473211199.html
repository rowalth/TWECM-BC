But I couldn't find this person in the group, so if you know her or can help me get in touch that would be great, I would love for us to connect.

      <div>Hi all, I'm reworking my niche but my ICA are mums who want to love themselves and create a life they love whilst being present for the kids and without soul shaming mum guilt. They have been putting others first for way too long and are ready to connect with themselves and what lights them up on a deeper level. They want to get intentional about living life more fully, increase their overall happiness and be conscious parents who raise happier and more confident children by virtue of the fact that they are happier and more confident in themselves. Would love to connect if this resonates. 💗💗💗<br>Florance achama ukpabi</div>
