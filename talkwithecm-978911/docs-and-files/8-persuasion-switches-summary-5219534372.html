      <div><strong>talkwithecm:<br></strong>SSI - SYCWS course<br>+How to introduce yourself without feeling awkward.<br>+Yes, you can showcase your best self to future employers EVEN IF you feel awkward, shy or you can never think of the right words to say until after the opportunity has passed.&nbsp;<br>+Would you rather just keep doing things the way that you have been doing them and wonder what could have been different if you took a chance to work with me...<br>+Would you rather take another boring English course, or sign up with me and get powerful videos and insights you can view directly from your phone?<br>+Wondering how this is different from the gazillion other solutions out there? Here's how:</div><ul><li>English with a purpose, 100% online, videos, worksheets, etc.</li></ul><div>+Imagine how it will be one year from now - you have a job you love, utilising your sills and passion to make a difference in the world...and your inbox is overflowing with messages from people wanting to get in touch, excited to get in touch with you - coffee dates, meetings, even new job offers, instead of struggling to get someone - anyone's attention, you are the one in full control of deciding who and when you want to talk to.&nbsp;<br>+You may look at me and think I have everything together, but the reality is a bit different - 9 times out of 10 I leave home without my wallet and/or phone...or if I do have my phone with me, it only has 10% battery left. I'll pack my daughter's bag with 14 snacks, but forget the diapers. Or show up at an important meeting with pants that are 4 sizes too large.&nbsp;<br>+I am just like you, I used to get sick to my stomach when I knew that I had to give a talk, in fact, I still get butterflies in my stomach before a big presentation or meeting someone new, but now I know exactly how to channel that energy into success.</div>

      <div>You're only aware of the advertised jobs...but you know the <strong>best</strong> jobs don't get advertised...you're at the mercy of job boards (HR / recruiters)<br><br>You know your peers are getting paid more but you just don't want to have the awkward conversation. So you work harder and hope your work will speak for itself.&nbsp;<br><br>Basically, you are NOT in control. You make short term and emotional decisions with long term consequences.&nbsp;</div>
