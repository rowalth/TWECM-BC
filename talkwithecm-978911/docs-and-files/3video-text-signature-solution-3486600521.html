      <div>3 Video:<br>thanks for email, now download<br><br>Hi, Elizabeth here &amp; I want to congratulate you for taking this step and downloading my blueprint.&nbsp;<br>(break)<br><br>If you are tired of your current English skills holding you back, you have come to the right place. Today I will share with you my proven system that has the ability to change couch potato wimps into centre stage rock stars.&nbsp;<br><br>(break)<br><br>My blueprint will get you on the fast track and show you exactly how to connect with people and communicate beyond your current English language level and help you jump from your sofa to your dream job!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>(break)<br><br><del>Building your confidence to speak English one part of a greater journey… and I have a PROVEN system with a very SPECIFIC framework to get you from where you are today to where you want to be. Imagine, you’ll be able to confidently approach new people at a social or business event, and always know exactly what to say.<br></del><br><del>(break)<br><br>In this blueprint, I combine everything you need to systematically improve your communication skills and get game changing results.&nbsp;<br><br>As you can see on the left side there are 3 core steps:&nbsp;<br>Discover yourself<br>Build your message<br>Engage others<br></del><br></div><ul><li><del>Also, notice how one piece in each section looks a bit different - that is because these steps are what I consider my bulletproof plan - the extra step to solidify and make sure that you are ready. Usually people don't even think about these steps &amp; waste a lot of time bumbling around with trial &amp; error. By using my blueprint and built-in bulletproof plan, you know that you have done the prework that most people forget &amp; you can feel that much more confident before you EVEN start speaking.</del></li></ul><div><del>(break)<br><br>Let's get started:<br><br>Step 1: Discover yourself - This stage is all about taking a serious look at who you are and what skills and talents you bring to the table.&nbsp; Because you already have a lot to share with others and add value.</del></div><ul><li><del>The first thing is to identify your professional self - dig deep &amp; really discover who you are. What experiences have you already had that make you who you are today? What are your successes? What challenges did you face? What have you tried &amp; failed? Considering both your successes &amp; failures helps give a fuller picture of yourself. Because it is not so much about what happened that is important, but rather what have you learned from the experience and can apply to new situations that really matters. In other words, if you gained knowledge &amp; learned from your failures, that is really valuable!</del></li><li><del>Be Memorable - How much do you know about Charisma &amp; First impressions? We've all met that person, you know the one who seems to be completely comfortable and confident &amp; it feels good just to be around them. Well, for most people these things don't just come naturally, they are learned &amp; you can learn them too. Walking into a room, how do you decide who to approach? How do you start a conversation? How much eye contact is enough &amp; how much is too much? Learning how to read subtle signals from others and Mastering the art of body language enables you to connect with others on a whole new level and make a lasting impression.</del></li><li><del>Conquer your inner critic - This is key. I'm talking about that little voice inside your head that says you can't do it, or worse that you shouldn't even try. Why would anyone listen to me? What if I don't have the right credentials? What if they think I'm stupid? Your inner critic can be a good guide to challenge yourself and to make good decisions, but it should not paralyse you or stop you from taking action. Remember that there are a lot of things about you that people can't even see until you show them:</del><ul><li><del>Your education/experience</del></li><li><del>Your hard work to get where you are today</del></li><li><del>Your kind personality</del></li></ul></li></ul><div><del>(break)</del><strong><del><br></del></strong><del><br>Step 2: Build your message - In this step, it is time to focus on the tools and frameworks you need to find your own voice and create a compelling message.

What is the most important thing that you want people to know after you walk away? Creating one power packed sentence that combines the most essential elements of your message makes it easier for you to build your whole message. What is the best way to construct your key message? How can you drive home the main idea, but is still be relatable without being too boring or forced? Well built key statements act like a filter system - making it clear what should be included in your message &amp; (more importantly) what needs be left out.</del></li><li><del>Make your message irresistible -</del> Whether you are having a quick chat at a happy hour or preparing a 4 hour workshop, what will you do to captivate your audience, keep things things interesting and have asking for more?</li><li>&nbsp;Do you want to start with a question? Tell a joke?&nbsp;</li><li>Across the globe and across cultures, people respond to stories. There is some magic about a good story that draws us in &amp; makes us want to know more.
