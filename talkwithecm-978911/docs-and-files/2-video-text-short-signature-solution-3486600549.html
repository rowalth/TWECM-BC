I created this system to get you from wherever you are today to where you want to be.<br><br>(break)<br><br>In this blueprint, I combine everything you need to systematically improve your communication skills and get game changing results.&nbsp; Imagine, you’ll be able to confidently approach new people at a social or business event, and always know exactly what to say.<br><br>In this video, I'm only going to go through it quickly,<span style="background-color: rgb(250, 247, 133);"> because you'll get your own copy in a few minutes. <br></span><br>Let's get started:<br><br>As you can see on the left side there are 3 core steps: <br>Discover yourself<br>Build your message<br>Engage others<br><br>Also, notice how one piece in each section looks a bit different - that is because these pieces are what I consider my bulletproof plan - but I'll tell you more about that later.<br><br>Step 1: Discover yourself - <br>This stage is all about taking a serious look at who you are and what skills and talents you bring to the table, because you already have a lot to share with others and add value.<br><br>The first thing is to identify your professional self - dig deep &amp; really discover who you are. <strong>&nbsp;Try to answer the following questions: <br></strong>What experiences have you already had?&nbsp; <br>What challenges did you face? <br>What have you tried &amp; failed? <br>Considering both your successes &amp; failures helps give a fuller picture of yourself. In life it is not so much about what happened that is important, but rather what have you learned from the experience and can apply to new situations that really matters.<br><br>Be Memorable - How much do you know about Charisma &amp; First impressions? <br><strong>In this step I guide you to find answers to the following questions: </strong>Walking into a room, how do you decide who to approach? How do you start a conversation? How much eye contact is enough &amp; how much is just creepy? <br>Taking the time to read subtle signals from others and Mastering the art of body language enables you to connect with others on a whole new level and make a lasting impression.<br><br>Now I want to talk about my bulletproof plan. This is the extra layer that most people don't even think about and it sets you up for excellence. <br><br>Conquer your inner critic - <br>I'm talking about that little voice inside your head that says you can't do it, or worse that you shouldn't even try. Why would anyone listen to me? What if I don't have the right credentials? What if they think I'm stupid? <br><strong>Look, it is fine that these questions pop up, it's normal &amp; happens to just about everyone. But I challenge you to make this small effort now, so that you'll prepared with the right answers when it really counts. </strong><br><br>(break)<br><br>Step 2: Build your message - <br><strong>In this step it is important to follow the guidelines step by step so that you get the best results. </strong>&nbsp;Zero in on the exact words you will use to deliver your message, as well as the essential components you need to captivate others, such as how to use<br>-storytelling <br>-humor<br>-a call to action<br>-&amp; staying true to your own personal style<br><br>Write your Key statement - <br>What is the most important thing that you want people to know after you walk away? Creating one power packed sentence that combines the most essential elements of your message makes it easier for you to build your whole message. <br><br>Make your message irresistible - <br>Whether you are having a quick chat at a happy hour or preparing a 4 hour workshop, find ways to captivate your audience &amp; keep things things interesting. <br><br>No fail messaging! - <br>This is the second piece in my bulletproof plan. This is the extra assurance that you'll know exactly what to say no matter what happens.
