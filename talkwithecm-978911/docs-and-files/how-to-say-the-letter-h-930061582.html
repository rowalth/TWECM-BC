      How to say the letter H
      
    </h1>

    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>The Letter H<br><br></div><div>Email:</div><div>The letter H is very controversial. It is perhaps one of the most controversial letters among English speakers. What is the correct way to say it &amp; when?</div><div><br></div><div>Although it may seem like a lot of crazy nonsense, there are actually some rules and patterns that can make your life easy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Perhaps you feel like you mastered the sound of the letter H way back when you learned how to sing Happy Birthday. That nice soft light breath of air, which doesn’t require any tricky movement form the lips or tongue...or does it? Keep reading to learn more.</div><div><br></div><ul><li>What about when it is paired with another letter, like phone, Thai &amp; who?</li><li>When is it silent?</li><li>Did you know that native English speakers can’t even agree on how to pronounce the name of this letter?&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>The Letter H</h1><h1>The controversial letter H - seriously.</h1><ul><li>Did you know that native English speakers can’t even agree on how to pronounce the name of this letter?&nbsp;</li><li>Is it Aitch or Haitch? - both are used, &amp; some people even switch!</li><li>H-dropping &amp; H-adding groups...where people, native English speakers in a certain region are just pronouncing things different than others. The H-droppers are not saying the ‘h’ sound when they should &amp; the H-adders are tossing it into words where is does not belong.&nbsp;</li><li>It started a war...ok, thats not true, but I did get a lot of comments when I mentioned that the H is silent in herbs the other day...</li><li>Some famous differences between GB English and its American counterpart involve H. In GB we have SCHEDULES with a /ʃ/, but in America they are /ˈskedʒəlz/. GB cooks like the H in HERBS, whereas they prefer /ˈɜːrbz/ across the pond.&nbsp;</li><li>The good news for English learners is that both are correct, but you might want to chose the option that best matches your surroundings</li></ul><div><br></div><h1>The unvoiced sound of the letter H</h1><div><br></div><div>The H sound makes little sound. It is a very quiet sound. It is made by passing air through your mouth. A common error of English students is to overproduce this sound.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To make the sound, lightly constrict your throat and breath out through your mouth. When done correctly, your vocal chords will not vibrate. The shape of your lips will depend on the spelling of the word.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Spellings<br><br></div><div>The H sound is usually spelled with only the letter H: how, behind, he.</div><div><br></div><div>Sometimes, the H sound is spelled with the letters WH: who, whom, whole.</div><div><br></div><div>In English, the H sound will never be at the very end of a word. The H sound only appears at the <a href="http://www.really-learn-english.com/english-pronunciation-lesson-02-word-stress-and-syllables.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">beginning of syllables</a>. (ex English, french, hannah, bar mitzvah)</div><div><br></div><div>Silent or not?</div><div>Some English words borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">French</a> begin with the letter ⟨h⟩ but not with the sound /h/. Examples include <em>hour</em>, <em>heir</em>, <em>hono(u)r</em> and <em>honest</em>. In some cases, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_pronunciation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">spelling pronunciation</a> has introduced the sound /h/ into such words, as in <em>humble</em>, <em>hotel</em> and (for most speakers) <em>historic</em>. Spelling pronunciation has also added /h/ to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">British English</a> pronunciation of <em>herb</em>, /hɜːb/, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">American English</a> retains the older pronunciation /ɝb/. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Etymology</a> may also serve as a motivation for H-addition, as in the words <em>horrible</em>, <em>habit</em> and <em>harmony</em>; these were borrowed into Middle English from French without an /h/ (<em>orribel, abit, armonie</em>), but all three derive from Latin words with an /h/ and would later acquire an /h/ in English as an etymological "correction".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-dropping#cite_note-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[11]</a> The name of the letter H itself, "aitch", is subject to H-insertion in some dialects, where it is pronounced "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">haitch</a>". In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-English" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hiberno-English</a>, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">haitch</a>" is considered standard.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-dropping#cite_note-12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[12]</a></div><h1>H is always silent in HONOUR, HOUR, HONEST, HEIR, VEHICLE &amp; VEHEMENT. You don’t say it after ‘g’ in GHOST, GHASTLY, AGHAST, GHERKIN &amp; GHETTO, or after ‘r’ in RHINOCEROS, RHUBARB, RHYME and RHYTHM. It’s normally silent after ‘w’: WHAT? WHICH? WHERE? WHEN? WHY? but it’s pronounced in WHO? – “Who’d have thought it?”. And we don’t always say it after ‘ex’ –&nbsp; which is either EXHILARATING… or EXHAUSTING.</h1><h1>Silent H</h1><div><em>Rule 1: H is not pronounced when it comes after W (n.b. some speakers whisper the H before the W).<br></em><br></div><div><em>Examples: what, when, where, whether, why<br></em><br></div><div><em>Rule 2: H is not pronounced at the beginning of many words (remember to use the article “an” with unvoiced H).<br></em><br></div><div><em>Examples: hour, honest, honour, heir<br></em><br></div><div><em>Exceptions: hill, history, height, happy, hereditary (Plus most other words beginning with H that are NOT of French origin – and remember to use the article “a” with voiced H)<br></em><br></div><div><em>Rule 3: H is often not pronounced when it comes after C, G or R.<br></em><br></div><div><em>Examples: choir, chorus, ghastly, ghoul, aghast, echo, rhinocerous, rhythm<br></em><br></div><div><em>The rule goes that the article ‘a’ is used before a consonant and ‘an’ is used before a vowel, so with silent H we would say “an honest” and with pronounced H we would say “a hotel”. But some posher speakers tend to treat a pronounced H as if it were not there, so they would say “an historic” and “an hotel”. H droppers tend to always use ‘an’, so cockneys would say “Give us an (h)and” and “She’s renting an (h)ouse”.</em></div><div><br></div><div>Hannah /ˈhɑnə/ (haa-nə) UK, /ˈhænə/ (hæ-nə) US; on the other hand, it is the final “h” that is silent in this name, not the first one. The same is true for all words of Hebrew origin ending with “ah”, e.g. Bar Mitzvah.<br><br></div><div>Silent H&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Rule 1: The letter H is usually silent when it appears after W.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>• Why, what, when, weather, where.<br><br></div><div>Rule 2: Sometimes the letter H is not silent after W, consider the words below.<br><br></div><div>• Whose, whosoever, who, whoever, whole.<br><br></div><div>Rule 3: H is mute at the beginning of many words (remember to use the article “an” with unvoiced H).<br><br></div><div>• Hour, honest, honour, heir.<br><br></div><div>Rule 4:<em> Exceptions:</em> Most of the words beginning with H are not silent (remember to use the article “a” with voiced H)<br><br></div><div>• History, Historical, Hair, Happy.<br><br></div><div><br>exhausted /ɪɡˈzɔːstɪd/ (ig-zaw-stid); notice also that “x” at the beginning is pronounced as “gz”, not as “ks”.<br><br></div><div><br>Thai /taɪ/; “th” in English is usually pronounced as /θ/ (as in “think”) or /ð/ (as in “the”), but in “Thai”, is is pronounced just as “t”. The same applies to Thailand too, of course.<br><br></div><div><br>vehicle /ˈviːəkl/ (vee-ə-kl); some speakers of American English pronounce the “h”, but the vast majority keep the “h” silent and consider the pronunciation with an “h” unnatural.<br><br></div><div><br>ghost /ɡəʊst/ (gəust) UK, /ɡoʊst/ (g<em>oh</em>st) US; to end our discussion about the silent “H”, notice that it is also silent in “ghost”. This is in fact the case with all words beginning with “gh”, such as ghetto /ˈgɛtəʊ/ (ge-təu) UK, /ˈgɛtoʊ/ (ge-t<em>oh</em>) US, ghastly /ˈɡɑːstli/ (gaast-lee) UK, /ˈɡæstli/ (gæst-lee) US, and ghee /ɡiː/ (g-ee).<br><br></div><div>Note: The word “herb” and words derived from it (such as “herbal”) are usually pronounced with an H at the beginning in British and Australian English, while it usually remains silent in American and Canadian English.<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>TH, GH, SH, PH<br><br></div><h1>The sound /h/ is always spelt with an H. But that’s not the only time we see it in English. It combines with ’t’ to make the two dental fricatives /θ/ in THINK and /ð/ in THIS. It combines with ’s’ to make /ʃ/ in SHAME, POSH &amp; FASHION, and with c to make /tʃ/ in CHIMNEY &amp; WATCH. ‘ph’ is normally pronounced /f/ like in PHENOMENAL &amp; ELEPHANT, but not in SHEPHERD. Sometimes ‘gh’ is also /f/ at the end of a syllable ENOUGH! but it’s more likely to be silent – WEIGH, THIGH, THROUGH, THOROUGH &amp; BOROUGH. Oh and let’s not forget the /p/ in HICCOUGH.</h1><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>Silent GH</h1><div><em>Rule 1: GH is not pronounced when it comes after a vowel.<br></em><br></div><div><em>Examples: Thought, drought, through, thorough, borough, daughter, light, might, sigh, right, fight, weigh, weight<br></em><br></div><div><em>Exceptions: Doghouse, foghorn, bighead (As you can see, the exceptions are generally compound words i.e. words that have been formed by combining two complete words)<br></em><br></div><div><em>Rule 2: GH is sometimes pronounced like F.<br></em><br></div><div><em>Examples: rough, tough, laugh, enough, cough, clough, draught<br></em><br></div><div><em>Exceptions: Examples from rule 1!<br></em><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Silent GH<br><br></div><div>Rule 1: GH is not pronounced when it comes after a vowel in a word.<br><br></div><div>• High, light, thought, through alight.<br><br></div><div>Rules 2: <em>Exceptions:</em> GH is pronounced separately in compound words (As you can see in the following words that exceptions are generally compound words).<br><br></div><div>• Doghouse, bighead, foghorn.<br><br></div><div>Rule 3: Except examples from rule 1, GH is sometimes pronounced like F, consider the words below.<br><br></div><div>• Draught, cough, laugh, tough.<br><br></div><div>What's the origin of the words with the silent 'gh' like daughter, night, light,&nbsp; bright, dough, bough (branch of a tree) and why is 'gh' in cough and enough&nbsp; pronounced with a 'f'?<br><br></div><div>That difficult -gh- letter pattern is from the Anglo- Saxons - daughter, night, cough, dough, bright... the -gh- used to be -h- and pronounced like the Scottish loch, a hard sound - until the French invaded and messed around with our spelling and added the g. Then the -gh- became silent or pronounced with a 'f' sound.<br><br></div><h1>Silent PH</h1><div><em>Rule: PH is sometimes pronounced like F.<br></em><br></div><div><em>Examples: telephone, paragraph, alphabet, epiphany, sophomore<br></em><br></div><div>Silent PH<br><br></div><div>Rule: PH is sometimes pronounced like F.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>• Sophia, paragraph, elephant, telephone.<br><br></div><div>Silent W<br><br></div><div>Rule 2: W is silent in the following words:<br><br></div><div>• Who, whose, whole, whom, whole, whoever, answer, sword, two.<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br><br><br></div><div>IMPORTANT: Pronunciation matters a lot. Despite, having good grammar accuracy and vocabulary power if your pronunciation is imprecise or wrong your speaking will be ineffective.<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>NOW in spoken ENglish…<br><br></div><div><br>Weak H<br><br></div><div>Now that we have gone through the rules and tried to make things as clear as possible, let’s take this out of the classroom and take a look at English in the WILD, or spoken English.<br><br></div><div>Let’s take the words: HE, HIM, HIS, HER, HAVE, HAD &amp; HAS. It is pretty clear that we do pronounce the H sound for all of these words, especially as many of them become others words without this H sound at the start:<br><br></div><div>His - is<br><br></div><div>Have - ave<br><br></div><div>Had - ad<br><br></div><div>Has - as<br><br></div><div>Yet, all of these words tend to lose the H sound if the word doesn’t appear at the beginning. So we say H in “He’s ok”, but not in “Is he really?”. We pronounce it in “Have you finished”, but not in “You must have done it”.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-dropping" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-dropping</a></div><div>H - pairs</div><div></div>
