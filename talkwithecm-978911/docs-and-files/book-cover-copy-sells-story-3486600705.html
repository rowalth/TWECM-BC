      book cover - copy sells, story

      <div><strong>Cover attracts, copy sells.<br></strong>A friend of mine recently learned this hard lesson about sales shortly after releasing her first book. She had a beautiful cover. She had powerful images to attract, the right colors to create a mood, everything fit. But after it debuted on the best-seller list it quickly sank. Sales were plummeting...but she wasn't sure why. It was getting great reviews. The people who read it - LOVED it, but...why weren't more people buying?</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The reality of verbal branding:</strong><br>There is no funnel, no strategy, no sales video, no ad strategy - nothing that is going to make a bad message effective!<br><br>So, what is your core message? This is your foundation and will determine what your path to success will look like. Is it going to be a long track up to the peak of a mountain, an uphill battle in the snow, sleet and rain? Or will it be more like a walk down to the beach, listening to your favorite tunes along the way?<br><br>Sometimes it really is as simple as that. Are people responding to your message with likes, comments, shares, screaming "YES - I need this!" and throwing their wallets at you? Or are you starting at an empty bank account and wondering why people just aren't buying?&nbsp;<br><br>If you sell something people don't need....it's hard! You'll spend way to much time trying to convince people, begging people to just try your product. No one wants to do that.&nbsp;<br><br>butt pimple<br>UTI</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><del><br>With so many job seekers flooding the market with CVs, employers receive an average of 250 applications per job posting. 250!<br></del><br></div><div><del>The hard truth is that most CVs are cut by computer filters before a human eye even sees it. Despite the painstaking hours you put into making your CV perfect, it is only one small piece of what employers want to know - </del><strong><del>who are you and how can you bring value to our team?<br></del></strong><br></div><div><del>That's the key question - isn't it? Not just for hiring managers or getting a job, but also for making a sales pitch, reaching new clients, opening new markets, negotiating mergers, making friends in a new city - who are you and what value are you bringing into the equation?<br>This is the question you need to answer.&nbsp;</del></div><div><del>What are your options?<br></del><br></div><ul><li><del>Keep playing the numbers game - it will work, eventually.</del></li><li><del>Work with a recruiter or headhunter - but then you'll have to evaluate the cost, considering the limited access to diverse companies and direct competition with other top candidates.</del></li><li><del>Start reading the huge pile of books and blogs about how to connect with others.</del></li><li><del>Sign up for my course and get game changing results within 30 days </del><strong><del>– guaranteed!</del></strong></li></ul><div><br></div><div><br></div><div></div>
