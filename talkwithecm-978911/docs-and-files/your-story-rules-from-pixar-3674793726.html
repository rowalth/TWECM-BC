      <div>Once upon a time_____, and every day_____, until one day_____, and because of that_____ and because of that_____until finally______ and ever since then______.<br><br>Pixar story artist Emma Coats has<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/lawnrocket" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> tweeted</a> a series of “story basics” over the past month and a half — guidelines that she learned from her more senior colleagues on how to create appealing stories:<br><br></div><div><em>#1: You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#2: You gotta keep in mind what’s interesting to you as an audience, not what’s fun to do as a writer. They can be v. different.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#3: Trying for theme is important, but you won’t see what the story is actually about til you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#4: Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#5: Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#6: What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?<br></em><br></div><div><em>#7: Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#8: Finish your story, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#9: When you’re stuck, make a list of what WOULDN’T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#10: Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#11: Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#12: Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th – get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#13: Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it’s poison to the audience.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#14: Why must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#15: If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#16: What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don’t succeed? Stack the odds against.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#17: No work is ever wasted. If it’s not working, let go and move on - it’ll come back around to be useful later.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#18: You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best &amp; fussing. Story is testing, not refining.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#19: Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.<br></em><br></div><div><em>#20: Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How d’you rearrange them into what you DO like?<br></em><br></div><div><em>#21: You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can’t just write ‘cool’. What would make YOU act that way?<br></em><br></div><div><em>#22: What’s the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.<br></em></div>
