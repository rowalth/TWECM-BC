      <div><br>The art of writing headlines<br><br></div><div>Composing irresistible headlines doesn’t <strong>start</strong> with applying a nifty formula.<br><br></div><div>Instead, start with getting to know your market - your target audience - the exact people who want to hear your message.&nbsp;<br><br>Dreams &amp; Nightmares<br>What are their desires? What are their pains? Which questions or topics keep them tossing and turning at night. Find out where their struggles are and why they can’t make up their minds.&nbsp;<br><br>If you don't know - don't guess!<br>Ask them what they’re struggling, then answer their most burning questions. Figure out which quick tips can solve their biggest problems and deliver fast results. Help them deal with niggling irritations and soul-destroying frustrations.<br><br></div><div>When your headline uses a proven formula <strong>and </strong>addresses the exact questions that your market is asking, you will strike a winning combination to stop the scroll and grab the attention of the exact people who want what you are offering.&nbsp;<br><br>You’ll see your social shares grow and your traffic soar.&nbsp;That’s how you become the goto authority in your field.<br><br></div><div>Remember this golden rule: ALWAYS focus on the people!</div><div><br>(Biggest dreams &amp; desires) - (burning pains, struggles &amp; barriers) + your solution = headline win<br><br></div><div><em>Headline Formula #1:&nbsp;</em></div><div><strong>The Burning Question<br></strong><br></div><div><strong>Examples:<br></strong><br></div><ol><li>Is Brand a Google Ranking Factor? (<a href="https://moz.com/blog/is-brand-a-google-ranking-factor-whiteboard-friday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Moz</a>)</li><li>Do You Really Need That Exclamation Point? (<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/exclamation-point-flowchart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HubSpot</a>)</li><li>Will Your Website Survive the Google Mobile Penalty?

(<a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2015/06/22/fat-shaming-vs-body-acceptance-where-do-we-draw-the-line/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nerd Fitness</a>)</li><li>How Much Do Keywords Still Matter? (<a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/do-keywords-still-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">KISSmetrics</a>)</li><li>How Much Copy to Write on Your Home Page? (<a href="http://conversionxl.com/much-copy-write-home-page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ConversionXL</a>)</li><li>Do You Truly Know How to Love Yourself? (<a href="http://www.louisehay.com/do-you-truly-know-how-to-love-yourself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Louise Hay</a>)</li></ol><div><strong>The formula:</strong><br><em>Ask the most burning question in your niche<br></em><br></div><div><strong>Why this formula works: </strong><br>Questions arouse our <a href="https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/curiosity-gap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">curiosity</a>.<br><br></div><div>We all grapple with tricky questions. We debate hot topics in our industries. We turn to Google to find answers. Who doesn’t want to know the answer on a burning question?<br><br></div><div>The <em>Burning Question</em> formula is probably the most underused formula on the list. But its attraction is undeniable: the third most popular post on Moz (8.2k shares) and the fifth most popular post on HubSpot (13k shares) use this formula. We also know from <a href="http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/jeopardy-effect.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">research </a>that questions get more clicks on Twitter than statements, , and that subject lines with question marks get 44% more opens than those with exclamation marks (<a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/email-marketing/research-study/prweb13050971.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">source</a>).<br><br></div><div><strong>How to apply this headline formula: </strong><br>Which burning questions do your readers struggle to get answered? Which hot debates are going on in your industry? Use the question as your headline and provide an in-depth answer in your post.<br><br></div><div><em>Headline Formula #2:</em></div><div><strong>The Classic How-To<br></strong><br></div><div><strong>Examples:<br></strong><br></div><ol><li>How to Eat on Less Than $1.00/meal (<a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/2015/03/dollar-meal-budgeting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Budgets Are Sexy</a>)</li><li>How to Turn 1 Idea Into 2 Months of Content Marketing (and More) (<a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/07/one-idea-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Content Marketing Institute</a>)</li><li>How to Cut a Wine Bottle into a Candle Hurricane (<a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/how-to/intro/0,,20637631,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">This Old House</a>)</li><li>How to Talk to Your Angriest Customers (<a href="https://www.helpscout.net/blog/customer-complaints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Help Scout</a>)</li><li>How to Write the Highest-Performing AdWords Ads, Ever (<a href="http://unbounce.com/ppc/write-high-performing-adwords-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Unbounce</a>)</li></ol><div><strong>The formula:</strong><br><em>How to [Achieve Something Specific]<br></em><br></div><div><strong>Why this formula works: </strong><br>The How-To headline promises us a solution to a problem. This formula works best when you make the problem as specific as possible. For instance, instead of learning how to cook cheap meals, the first example above promises you’ll learn <em>how to eat on less than $1.00/meal</em>. And instead of learning how to write ads, you’ll learn <em>how to write the highest-performing AdWords ads, ever</em>.<br><br></div><div><strong>How to apply this headline formula: </strong><br>What problems are your readers struggling with? How can you narrow down this problem to make your post more specific? If you’re unsure, ask your social media followers or email subscribers what they’re struggling with (I did this in December and readers generously suggested enough topics for the coming months).<br><br></div><div>Remember, generic headlines sound bland; specificity adds interest.<br><br></div><div><em>Headline Formula #3:</em></div><div><strong>The How-To Case Study<br></strong><br></div><div><strong>Examples:<br></strong><br></div><ol><li>How I Built an Online T-Shirt Business and Made $1,248.90 in 3 Weeks (<a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/50559813-how-i-built-an-online-t-shirt-business-and-made-1-248-90-in-3-weeks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Shopify</a>)</li><li>How We Increased Our Facebook Traffic by 332% in 2015 (<a href="https://syedbalkhi.com/how-we-increased-our-facebook-traffic-by-332-in-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Syed Balkhi</a>)</li><li>How I Paid off $46,500 of Student Loans in 2 years (<a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/2015/07/tips-paying-off-student-loan-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Budgets Are Sexy</a>)</li><li>How Zapier Went From Zero to 600,000+ Users in Just Three Years (<a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/zapier-interview-with-wade-foster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Groove</a>)</li></ol><div><strong>The formula:</strong><br><em>How [I/We/CompanyX] [Achieved Something Specific] in [Time Frame]<br></em><br></div><div><strong>Why this formula works: </strong><br>This is a variation of the Classic How-To headline. The headline arouses curiosity by sharing a story about a specific person or company. Of course, as readers, we hope to learn something from this case study.<br><br></div><div>Note how the headline examples are all ultra-specific. <em>How to Build an E-Commerce Business</em> would have been generic and bland; it doesn’t arouse curiosity. In contrast, the case study variation makes the headline far more interesting: <em>How I Built an Online T-Shirt Business and Made $1,248.90 in 3 Weeks</em>—this was the most shared post on Shopify in 2015, generating 9.6k social shares.<br><br></div><div><strong>How to apply this headline formula: </strong><br>Can you share a client case study? Can you interview someone for a case study? Or would your readers be interested in a story about your business? Remember to add specific results for credibility and interest.<br><br></div><div><em>Headline Formula #4:</em></div><div><strong>The Unexpected Comparison<br></strong><br></div><div><strong>Examples:<br></strong><br></div><ol><li>Why Content Marketing Trumps Advertising (<a href="http://heidicohen.com/content-marketing-trumps-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Heidi Cohen</a>)</li><li>Why Strong Customer Relationships Trump Powerful Brands (<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/04/why-strong-customer-relationships-trump-powerful-brands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Harvard Business Review</a>)</li><li>Why You Should Be Building Trust, Not Traffic (<a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/digital-marketing/why-you-should-build-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Convince and Convert</a>)</li><li>Why Exercising Is a Higher Priority Than My Business (<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Entrepreneur</a>)</li></ol><div><strong>The formula:</strong><br><em>Why [x] trumps [y]<br></em><br></div><div><strong>Why this formula works: </strong><br>We all have to make choices in life. Do we need to spend time on Facebook or SlideShare? Should we drink beer or coffee? Should we do Yoga or go jogging? Can we boost productivity by working more hours or fewer?<br><br></div><div>The <em>Comparison </em>headline promises us an answer to those difficult choices. It appears to work best when you try to bust a myth—when suggesting people should go for A, when everyone thinks B is better. This formula was used for the most popular post on Heidi Cohen’s blog (1.6k shares) and the second most shared post on Convince and Convert (4.6k shares).<br><br></div><div><strong>How to apply this headline formula: </strong><br>Which one persistent myth can you bust? What’s the most difficult choice your readers have to make? Use this formula to provide the definitive answer to the most heated debate in your industry. While you can write how-to and list headlines all year long, save this formula for the hottest debate in your industry this year.<br><br></div><div><em>Headline Formula #5:</em></div><div><strong>The Guide<br></strong><br></div><div><strong>Examples:<br></strong><br></div><ol><li>The Compact Guide to Grammar for Busy People (<a href="http://boostblogtraffic.com/english-grammar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Boost Blog Traffic</a>)</li><li>A Brief Guide to Fixing Your Old, Neglected, and Broken Content (<a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/fix-broken-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Copyblogger</a>)</li><li>A Data-Driven Guide to Creating Viral Content (<a href="http://backlinko.com/viral-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Backlinko</a>)</li><li>The Noob Guide to Understanding Pay-Per-Click Marketing (<a href="http://unbounce.com/ppc/ppc-basics-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Unbounce</a>)</li><li>A Scientific Guide to Saying “No”: How to Avoid Temptation and Distraction (<a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/a-scientific-guide-to-saying-no-how-to-avoid-temptation-and-distraction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Buffer</a>)</li></ol><div><strong>The formula:</strong><br><em>The [Adjective] Guide to [Specific Topic]<br></em><br></div><div><strong>Why this formula works: </strong><br>The Guide formula is another old classic, but be careful how you phrase the contents of your guide. Use unusual words and make the topic specific to avoid sounding like all those definitive and ultimate guides already gathering dust on the web. In a reader survey, <a href="https://moz.com/blog/2013-moz-blog-survey-results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Moz</a>found that nobody wanted to read another ultimate guide. In contrast, <em>“The </em><strong><em>Compact </em></strong><em>Guide to Grammar for Busy People”</em> was the most popular post on Boost Blog Traffic in 2015, generating 2.1k social shares.<br><br></div><div><strong>How to apply this headline formula: </strong><br>Which reader problems can you solve? Don’t try to solve all problems in one go; instead narrow down your topic as much as possible.<br><br></div><div><em>Headline Formula #6:</em></div><div><strong>Goofs, Errors, and Mistakes<br></strong><br></div><div><strong>Examples:&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><ol><li>9 Landing Page Goofs That Make You Lose Business (<a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/landing-page-goofs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Copyblogger</a>)</li><li>5 Common Mental Errors That Sway You From Making Good Decisions (<a href="http://jamesclear.com/common-mental-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">James Clear</a>)</li><li>7 Deadly Car Seat Mistakes Even Experienced Parents Make (<a href="http://blogs.babycenter.com/products_and_prizes/03052015-7-deadly-car-seat-mistakes-even-experienced-parents-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Babycenter</a>)</li></ol><div><strong>The formula:</strong><br><em>[n] [Topic] Goofs That [Lead to Damage]<br></em><br></div><div><strong>Why this formula works: </strong><br>Words like <em>errors</em>, <em>mistakes</em>, and <em>goofs </em>are power words, attracting our attention. We’re all afraid of making silly mistakes, so a list of mistakes arouses our curiosity, encouraging us to find out whether we’ve been silly, too.<br><br></div><div>Note how the second part of the headline often gives us an extra incentive to click through, either because it highlights how we can hurt ourselves (losing business or making wrong decisions) or because it stresses we’re making these mistakes, too (even experienced parents make these mistakes).<br><br></div><div><strong>How to apply this headline formula: </strong><br>Think about your readers and consider what mistakes they make. Or consider the errors you’ve made when starting out. Make sure your post also explains how to do your topic right.<br><br></div><div><em>Headline Formula #7:</em></div><div><strong>The Classic List Post<br></strong><br></div><div><strong>Examples:&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><ol><li>32 Legitimate Ways to Make Money at Home (<a href="http://www.thepennyhoarder.com/ways-to-make-money-at-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Penny Hoarder</a>)</li><li>7 Sneaky Ways to Bring Your Dialogue Alive (<a href="http://www.writers-village.org/writing-award-blog/seven-sneaky-ways-to-bring-your-dialogue-alive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Writers’ Village</a>)</li><li>15 Simple Ways to Spread Kindness in Your World Starting Today (<a href="http://www.positivityblog.com/index.php/2015/04/28/spread-kindness-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Positivity Blog</a>)</li><li>52 Ways to Tell Someone You Love and Appreciate Them (<a href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/52-ways-tell-someone-love-appreciate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tiny Buddha</a>)</li><li>9 Ways to Entertain Your Toddler Without Using a Smartphone (<a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2015/10/06/9-ways-to-entertain-your-toddler-without-using-a-smartphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Art of Manliness</a>)</li><li>3 Creative Ways to Hear Your Inner Truth (<a href="http://www.louisehay.com/3-creative-ways-to-hear-your-inner-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Louise Hay</a>)</li></ol><div><strong>The formula:</strong><br><em>[n] [Adjective] Ways to [Achieve Something Specific]<br></em><br></div><div><strong>Why this formula works: </strong><br>Getting tired of <a href="https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/how-to-write-a-listicle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">list posts</a>?<br><br></div><div>Think again.<br><br></div><div>List posts continue to be amazingly popular.

This formula works best when you make the topic as specific as possible. For example, instead of learning how to save money on food, offer something on <em>how to feed your family for less than 5</em>€<em>/meal</em>.

Add unusual words and make the topic specific to avoid sounding like all the other definitive and ultimate guides already gathering dust on the web.
