      <div><em><br>Note from Raelyn: Show them the first step of their journey with you. What’s the first quick win that people can get when they are in your program? This helps them to visualize how their journey will be like with you. They realize that, hey - I can actually achieve this particular quick win... it’s possible! And it opens up their eyes to the possibilities. For instance, if you help people find their soulmate, the quick win you talk about here is the 5-step process behind how they can get a high-quality date. Talk about how your program focuses on this so that within the first 2 weeks, they are able to go on a date. While someone may have difficulties believing that they could actually find soul mate love with you, it is a lot easier for them to believe that they would be able to find a high-quality date.<br></em><br></div><div><strong><br>Subject Line: Your First Quick Win<br>Email Copy:<br></strong>Hey [first name],<br>In [program name], we are focused on getting you your first quick win.<br><br></div><div>Today, I would like to share a sneak peek into the very first module of [program name] with you... which is [what is the quick win they can get?]<br><br></div><div>As you know, [program name] will help you to [ultimate end goal], and the first step to accomplish that would be to [what’s the first quick win they need to get to the ultimate end goal]?<br>In [program name], we use a [#]-step process to help you to get [the quick win].<br>We’ve had students who managed to [achieve the quick win] in as little as [time frame].
