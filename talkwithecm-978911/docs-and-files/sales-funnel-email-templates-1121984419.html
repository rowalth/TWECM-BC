You start talking about something you failed at and suddenly you get tons of comments like “I really needed to hear this today!!” and “Thanks for being so honest!” The only problem: The people who love to hear other stories about failures never turn into customers. They simply use your failure as their morning motivation. You’ve essentially turned yourself into the court jester. <br><br>Relatability is good and vulnerability can be good — if you’ve achieved something. But please, <a href="http://mkto-ab210104.com/d30Kz6gEbR0ZY00Kko000Z0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">stop writing about how vulnerable you are</a>.<br>&nbsp; <br><strong>Teasing Without Delivering the Goods</strong><br>&nbsp; <br><strong>EXAMPLE COPY:</strong> "I'm going to show you [HOW TO DO AMAZING THING], but first…" <br><br><strong>RAMIT’S COMMENT:</strong> It goes like this: “Hey guys, I’m going to show you how to save 20 hours a day on anything you do, but first let me tell you a story about my pet ferret. (LONG STORY.) Anyway, click my link. Thanks!” <br><br>Better to be clear than clever.<br>&nbsp; <br><strong>False Consensus</strong><br>&nbsp; <br><strong>EXAMPLE COPY: </strong>"So many people have been asking me about my amazing fat-burning tool” <br><br><strong>RAMIT’S COMMENT: </strong>You have 13 people on your email list. Nobody’s asking you for anything. It’s OK to be honest if you’re starting out and don’t have a lot of readers. It can be a strength!<br>&nbsp; <br><strong>False Scarcity</strong><br>&nbsp; <br><strong>EXAMPLE COPY: </strong>"While supplies last!" or "For a limited time" <br><br><strong>RAMIT’S COMMENT:</strong> I have no problem with scarcity. But when you say “This course closes tonight!” and it magically stays open for months on end, that’s a problem.<br>&nbsp; <br><strong>Unnecessary Bonuses</strong><br>&nbsp; <br><strong>EXAMPLE COPY:</strong> "But wait! There's more..." <br><br><strong>RAMIT’S COMMENT: </strong>I love bonuses and they are highly effective at selling products. My only callout here is when the bonuses are totally incongruent with the offer. For example, “Buy my coaching program to develop your self-confidence and I’ll donate $10 to poor kids in India.” What? <br><br>(Ironically, this tactic shows a complete lack of confidence in your product.) If you have a great product for a great audience, be confident in your offer.<br>&nbsp; <br><strong>Telling Me Who I Am (but Being Wrong)</strong><br>&nbsp; <br><strong>EXAMPLE COPY: </strong>"You're confident. You're bold. You want more out of life" or "You're a tired entrepreneur who just wants it to work" <br><br><strong>RAMIT’S COMMENT: </strong>You see this type of breathless copy primarily in women’s development and coaching. If executed right, it could be amazing — but it never is. Instead, they never quite nail the “you” part: Instead of being ultra-specific, they use Barnum statements like “You’re bold,” which are transparently vague and insulting to readers. Never do this.<br>&nbsp; <br>***<br>This is the internal list of Banned Copy that I distributed at IWT. <br><br>2 questions for you:Have you ever seen these types of copy?<br>What else should I add to the list?<br>-Ramit <br><br>P.S.

GETTING PERSONAL<br>Hi Elizabeth,</div><div><br>One of my hobbies is searching out the unvarnished, behind-the-scenes truth about excellence in any field. <br><br>For example, did you know that Antarctic explorers need over 3x as many calories as a normal person … <a href="http://mkto-ab210104.com/I060TZY0Kkz5E30R0f0KZ00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">which they get by eating slabs of butter</a>? <br><br>Or that fighter pilots don't decide if they should eject in the moment, when something bad happens. They decide years earlier, in training. (“<a href="http://mkto-ab210104.com/K00RkZK00KfU063Yz06E0Z0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">If X happens, eject</a>.”) <br><br>Or take comedian Martin Short, who preps for every talk show appearance with 18 pages of notes and 90 minutes of planning with the producer. (<a href="http://mkto-ab210104.com/lfKR7000K6Yz0Z03k0E0V0Z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">All for 5-10 minutes of banter between two veteran entertainers</a>.) <br><br>Most people think great performance is some sort of magical moment. That all the stars align and you perform better than ever before. <br><br>Nope. <br><br>Success is decided the day before, the weeks before, and the years before through training. <br><br>I see this in personal finance, where people think “rich” means winning the lottery (reality: you get rich through consistent, systematic decisions over your life). <br><br>I also see this in marketing, where people think a magical launch will make them a millionaire (reality: you learn how to write and sell <em>before</em> you need it). <br><br>Do the right prep work and you can make a big splash, high sales, and happy customers. Do the wrong prep work … and you have lost sales, angry unsubscribes, and months of wasted time. <br><br>To learn how to sell better — and get it right <em>before</em> it matters — I like to start by understanding our Invisible Scripts. Lots of entrepreneurs suffer from negative Invisible Scripts about sales — deep-seated beliefs that keep them from being themselves AND growing their business at the same time. <br><br>In our research for our brand new <a href="http://mkto-ab210104.com/dc/NWofD7QjQnNChi6kAYGvf7YClzsJaWoYhu4u8W0-cXbkFEfO7rSfww68zhTYbp58D2JVKI3dyY4YjhZL5LGIFFtE6UUs62MkvhLLzwE_eWzcaB6hlvvh7MZN2PzxjoF37sD7WYTHx4jq4NbOFDvnhq1WKjBYjNOouOlT4ZZuhl-UFHoJzktyb8h3gJuuU8RSpPZRte66HzgOkwC723US53N19QmYobOws_gYG1XYl9620JjxHY17U9NzYfOvEYav6HTFIjBlAmwYZcKmg9agHXtEOlMV7fvpzTMd96128dA=/Q0fZ0YK0ZW0KR0E63008kz0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Behind the Sales Email</em></a> program, we discovered 5 common Invisible Scripts about selling.<br><br>Most business owners struggle with at least 2 of these scripts … but some have all of them.

Use these and you'll get better results — and happier readers.<strong>Be clear, not clever. </strong>A subject line like “Hey” or “Critical mistake” is clever. An email like “New course: Creating an online business” is clear. Clever emails might get you short-term boosts in open rates, but people stop trusting you after a few of them.<strong>But also: Don't be boring. </strong>My #1 fear with writing copy is that it’s boring. If it’s boring, you’re dead. Game over. So whether I’m writing a 70-page sales page or a 10-line email, it is going to be entertaining first and foremost. Even before the educational part of it.<strong>Everyone should get value from the funnel. </strong>Even non-buyers.<strong>Whenever you can, add in photos of yourself working out.</strong> Boom!<br> <bc-attachment content-type="image" url="http://grow.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/rs/014-ZKZ-058/images/BTSE%20FRI3.jpg" width="480" height="640"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment> <br><strong>Go from the clouds to the street. </strong>Don’t talk about lofty concepts like freedom. Talk about having a leisurely morning with green tea. Don’t just say “worry-free” — talk about how you can afford to pay for a math tutor for your son. Take your ideas from the clouds — airy-fairy and vague — to the street, where you and I live.<strong>There are 3 skills of a great copywriter. </strong>First, know if it’s good or not (yes or no). Second, know WHY it’s good or not (much harder). Third, know HOW to make it good (the hardest skill of all). Our senior talent at GrowthLab knows all 3.<strong>Zig / Zag. </strong>People get a lot of email, a lot of pitches. Figure out what they're expecting … then do something different. For example, most people would be hard selling on the last day of a launch. But we’re sending you this email that you’re reading right now.<strong>Be honest. Admit your mistakes.</strong> I spent $2 million on FB ads and it didn’t work. Because of my management, we had to shut down a multimillion-dollar community product. I sent out an inflammatory email about bitcoin. Each was a mistake. I admitted each, in detail.<strong>People like to be sold.</strong> If you don't know what I'm talking about, stop shopping at Payless.<strong>Write like you talk.</strong> So many of you are great in person … and turn into weirdos the second you start typing. Just write like you talk.<strong>Assume your mom will read the email.</strong> (Hi Mom!) This forces you to have integrity in what you write. My mom, dad, Stanford professors, New York Times journalist friends, and many more read this. I intend to honor them and keep our quality up — always.<strong>People love learning about themselves.</strong> This explains why people love learning about their astrological sign (“Are you a Capricorn? OMGG I knew it, that makes so much sense!”).<strong>Read every email from your readers.</strong> My readers email me the juiciest stories that they would <em>never</em> share publicly. Why? Because they trust me! Build a relationship where your readers trust you. And read the emails! There is no better source of customer research.<strong>Be very careful who you learn from.</strong> If you study hype-filled, sleazy copy, those tactics will find their way into your writing. Who are you following?<strong>Push / Pull. </strong>Sales is emotional, not simply logical. If you’ve made all the logical arguments … congratulations, you have a boring series of emails. Push and pull by telling stories and jokes. Use long emails and short emails. Mix it up — but always have a purpose.<strong>Take your time. </strong>You don't have to get married on the first date. Slow down the tempo and trust that your copy can unfold over time.<strong>When it's time to sell — sell! </strong>Don't be ashamed. Don't hold back. Like this: If you’re reading this, you obviously want to know how to sell better. We’re doing it right now — as you’re reading <em>these words. </em><a href="http://mkto-ab210104.com/dc/NWofD7QjQnNChi6kAYGvf7YClzsJaWoYhu4u8W0-cXbkFEfO7rSfww68zhTYbp58D2JVKI3dyY4YjhZL5LGIFFtE6UUs62MkvhLLzwE_eWzcaB6hlvvh7MZN2PzxjoF37sD7WYTHx4jq4NbOFDvnhq1WKjBYjNOouOlT4ZZuhl-UFHoJzktyb8h3gJuuU8RSY7Wj-VweOFuyF1DlJDKaCCn7o0PL81b1Z79UexbRBvw6A2NdTuIMyFNSKDmVqrpg9Y5nOkWNPXKvCfi7qTQnS8PpJFrQxsiQ9SS11J3UoCg=/n0ZD0pn00TEK0ZK0D6003hj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">You should join our course to learn how to write better sales emails.</a><strong>Include real FAQs, not fake ones.</strong> I always laugh when I see BS FAQs like "How can I give you more money?" And I never buy. Get real and answer the real questions your audience has. Like: “Why should I buy this when there are 50 other products like yours out there?”<strong>Say "no.”</strong> Turn away customers if they're not a good fit. It builds trust when you have standards.

It’s a rapid course that surgically focuses on the 3 most important emails in your sales funnel. <br><br>Sales doesn't have to be spammy. You and your readers shouldn't feel sleazy after going through one of your launches. <br><br>You <em>can</em> sell and still be authentic and engaging. <br><br>But if your sales emails are sleazy … or boring … or predictable, your readers won't stick around for long. Everyone's inbox is crowded and if your sales emails don't stand out, your customers will be gone. Forever. <br><br>If your sales emails aren't driving sales, it doesn't matter how good the rest of your business is — your product, your support, your team. <br><br><em>Behind the Sales Email</em> gives you an under-the-hood look at how we create winning sales emails. In the course, I'll give you a personal tour of our Power Trio emails that we include in every launch. You'll see how we create and perfect our sales emails, and the traps along the way that most copywriters fall into. <br><br>You can watch the whole process on real sales emails, but I'm closing the doors tonight.<br> <bc-attachment content-type="image" url="http://gen.sendtric.com/countdown/1voda1z5p1" width="300" height="60"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">
