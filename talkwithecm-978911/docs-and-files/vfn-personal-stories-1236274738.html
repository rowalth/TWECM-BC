      <div>Story 1: Networking gap<br>Last spring, while meeting some friends for coffee, I met a woman who deeply understands the value of networking. She was in every professional networking group she could find, Women of Vienna, Professional Women's Network, and more. She was very well connected. When she decided to have a child, of course she joined the Vienna Family Network and everything was great, until she went back to work. Suddenly things started to change. For sure, the professional networks were helpful, but no one could answer her time constraints coordinating childcare and her work schedule. The VFN group gave her a lot of support, but she could no longer make it to the meetings. She felt caught between groups and wasn't sure where to find answers to her questions.&nbsp;<br><br>It seemed that no one could answer her questions about how to<br><br>Story 2: Pioneer<br>A know another women, a good friend of mine, who had her first child here in Vienna. Everything was new and she needed a lot of time to figure out all of the details that go with having a baby. Starting from zero, she felt like a pioneer, navigating the medical system, learning more than she ever wanted to know about diapers &amp; sleep schedules, coordinating child care so she could go back to work &amp; more! In fact, that was the one thing that she thought would be easy - going back to work. She really liked her job and the work she was doing. Going back to work was the one thing that she thought should be familiar, but it wasn't. She was surprised when when they wouldn't give her back the hours that she wanted or the projects that were important to her. She knew that she could fight for her rights...but she wasn't sure if she wanted to, or if it was really worth the effort.&nbsp; In the end, she did found a solution that works for her and her family, but more importantly she gained confidence to better manage the situation when she had her second child. Later she discovered that other parents in her company that had a similar experience.&nbsp;<br><br>mentor?</div>
