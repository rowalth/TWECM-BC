But then coworkers started coming up to me after meetings. “<em>Wow, you really didn’t like that guy, huh?</em>” they’d joke with me. “<em>What? What are you talking about!</em>” I’d panic. <em>How did they know! They must be witches!</em></div><div><br>No — my body language and energy were obvious. People know when you’re scared, annoyed, bored, or impatient.</div><div><br>How you walk into a room says a lot about you. <strong>You act consistently with who you think you are. </strong>If you’re afraid, ashamed, bored, or intimidated, people can tell almost immediately when you walk in the room.</div><div><br>Fortunately, you can change almost every factor involved — your mindset, posture, beliefs, and energy. But let’s start with the easy stuff — your shoulders, eye contact, and posture.</div><h1>Stand Straight, Walk Tall, Look People In the Eyes</h1><div><br>Your body language is very revealing. You can make people think — or not think — very important traits about you from how you posture yourself.</div><div><br>For starters — start walking around with your shoulders rolled back. This motion naturally raises your chin and helps you move around as tall as you can be.</div><div><br>There’s a very simple (and borderline silly) reason for all this — when you walk around acting like a tall, confident people, you’ll start to <em>feel</em> like one. It starts a cycle — good posture brings good thoughts, which in turn brings better posture, etc. You become what you think you are.</div><div><br>The next time you walk into a room, tackle it. Attack it. Go in with eyes wide open, scanning the room and the people in it. Roll your shoulders back. Want to be more confident? Then imagine how the most confident person in the world walks into a room — <em>then act more confident than that</em>.</div><div><br>Author and psychologist Jordan Peterson had some simple advice for this kind of situation: stand up straight with your shoulders back. Act confident, and you’ll feel confident.</div><div><br>Because the real scary part is that the opposite is also true — if you act afraid or intimidated, that’s how you’ll start to feel!</div><div><br>Droopy shoulders and a lowered, shy gaze will make you feel smaller, weaker, and vulnerable. Another cycle is created: bad posture creates bad thoughts, which creates worse posture…you get it.</div><div><br>It’s simple. It’s silly, even. But stand tall with your shoulders back. Make eye contact. Walk into a room like you own the damn place.</div><div><br>Pretty soon, it’ll start to feel that way.</div><h1>Practice Being a Great Conversationalist. Focus On Making People Laugh.</h1><blockquote><em><br>“The key to being a good conversationalist is probably a genuine unselfish interest in others. That, and practice.” -Frank Crane</em></blockquote><div><br>In the Academy Award-winning picture <em>The King’s Speech, </em>there’s a scene where speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) asks King George IV (Colin Firth), a chronic stammerer, “<em>Do you know any jokes?</em>”</div><div><br>The king hesitates. “<em>Eh…ehm…</em>” he stammers. “<em>T-timing isn’t my strong suit,</em>” he laughs darkly.</div><div><br>A lot of people have a difficult time with conversations with strangers, even acquaintances. I know I do. As Cal Fussman <a href="https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/a10890/windows-on-the-world-september-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">once penned</a>: “<em>We all know the feeling of wanting to do something so well and so badly that we try too hard and can’t do it at all</em>.”</div><div><br>20 years since speech therapy lessons in 3rd grade for my stuttering and stammering, I still find myself talking too fast. I mumble. I make jokes no one can hear, then laugh awkwardly to cover it up. People rarely laughed during conversations with me — they were busy trying to understand what I was even saying.</div><div><br>For a long time, this completely defined who I was. I decided it’d be best if I said as little as possible when meeting strangers (plus, that way I could increase my “mysterious” factor).</div><div><br>But I’ve worked hard to become a better conversationalist. I find I can make people laugh easier than before. I might still stutter (still working on that) and I still have trouble pronouncing “remember” and “statistic.” But for the most part, I feel comfortable and calm in conversations.</div><div><br>First: give people all your attention. As Ernest Hemingway once wrote, “<em>When people talk listen completely. Don’t be thinking what you’re going to say. Most people never listen.”</em> When you listen, you connect with people so much faster — people are naturally attracted to people who truly listen to them.</div><div><br>Also — stop people pleasing and flattering. No one likes it, and it doesn’t work. All it does is make you look silly and shady. I used to have a job where I had to go to networking events and meet people, and this was <em>exactly what I did all the time</em>. I tried flattery and fake praise just to get the sale. Guess how well that worked? (It didn’t. At all.)</div><h1>How to Activate Extreme Self-Confidence and Destroy Chronic Anxiety and Fear</h1><blockquote><em><br>“All confidence is acquired, developed. No one is born with confidence. Those people you know who radiate confidence, who have conquered worry, have acquired their confidence, every bit of it.” -Dr. David Schwartz, The Magic of Thinking Big</em></blockquote><div><br>A lot of people struggle with self-confidence and self-belief, especially around new people. When you lack these traits, you express that lack in other ways, like needing others to <a href="https://medium.com/@anthony_moore/how-to-unlearn-your-constant-need-to-be-liked-and-chosen-bb9548a9e3c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“choose” and like you</a>. This is a foundation for insecurity, fear, and lack of confidence.</div><div><br>It was for me. Growing up, I had virtually no self-confidence (especially not in my speaking ability). I had this constant need to be liked and chosen, and it came off as desperate and awkward. I was so busy trying to get you to like me, I was never myself.</div><div><br>If you can relate, I had good news for you: <strong>all confidence is developed</strong>.</div><div><br>No one is simply born with enormous, unshakeable confidence. You can develop and build your self-confidence over time, which will become apparent in conversations and your ability to make people laugh and smile. But it’s a rare trait. If you decide to become one of the few who develops this, your conversational skills will improve immensely.</div><div><br>Some easy strategies to start with:</div><ul><li>Start acting and speaking like successful speakers</li><li>Act even while you feel fear (do it anyway)</li><li>Seek problems out and prove to yourself that you’re capable</li><li>Start looking people in the eye whenever you speak with them (an uncomfortable but incredibly effective practice)</li><li>Open the front of your body. Hunched shoulders and a closed solar plexus inhibit confidence. Take deep belly-breaths, widen your shoulders, and raise your chin in conversation)</li></ul><div><br>There’s no end to developing your confidence. Remember, the best speakers, the most clever conversationalists, and most confident individuals learned those skills over time. You can, too.</div><h1>In Conclusion</h1><div><br>Be the kind of person who walks in a room and makes people think, “Wow, who’s the new guy? He looks like someone I’d like to meet.”</div><div><br>That might sound crazy to you. Maybe you’ve never thought that was even possible.</div><div><br>But all confidence is developed, learned. You can <a href="https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/heres-how-to-reprogram-your-brain-to-achieve-more-focus-on-your-goals-d9363b7ededb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">reprogram your brain</a> to become just about anyone. Change your identity from a timid, quiet wallflower to a confident, self-assured professional.</div><div><br>It’s not easy. It’ll take some time to unlearn your old ways that are holding you back.</div><div><br>But choose to become someone who walks into the room with confidence and purpose.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><ul><li><br></li></ul><div><br></div><div></div>
