      <div>Free Webinar - talkwithecm.com - Elizabeth Miller<br><br></div><div>Are you ready to learn how to make a great first impression and start building business relationships that matter? This webinar gives you the building blocks to talk to anyone, anywhere, at any time… whether it’s one-on-one or in a group setting, whether you're trying to get a job or build a friendship. <br><br>On Friday, June 28, I'm hosting a free LIVE webinar on <span style="background-color: rgb(250, 247, 133);">how to talk to anyone</span>.<br>Register right here on this page.<br><br></div><div><br>What if you could talk to anyone, anytime, anywhere using the power of body language to create an instant connection?<br><br>Here's an email from one member "I was so tired of waiting. So I took a job that was below my skill level. I thought it would be fine to start low just to get my foot in the door and take on more responsibilities later. I really wanted do something with my career...but I didn't know how to start. When I tried talking to people about it I felt awkward. I said the wrong things at the wrong time and people would just stare. It was awful! I felt so stuck."&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Sound familiar? And it is not only about talking to people you already know. How many of us have felt this way when talking to people we don't know - how about networking events, or interviews? Or what about making a presentation or big pitch for work?<br><br>Although the situations change, the story is the same: Unlike those people who always seem to know exactly the right things to say, when we say something, it comes out completely wrong. Or worse - we don't say anything at all.<br><br>If there is anything worse than saying the wrong things, it is saying nothing at all and being forgettable and staying stuck. No one wants to be forgettable, and feeling awkward isn't that great either.<br><br>Listen to this women's comment: "As a global citizen, I've moved around a lot, and now that I have children, well, there is a big gap in my CV. I used to get so irritated when people asked about the gap in my CV, but now after working with Elizabeth, it's my favorite question! I learned how to answer in a way that feels natural for me and highlights my skills."&nbsp;<br><br>Whether getting ready for an interview, giving a presentation at work, or looking to connect with new people - it feels so good when you know exactly what to do. I'm talking about all those nitty-gritty details like where to stand, how to make good eye contact, who talks first, what to say and all those things that can get in the way of what you want. I'd like show you how to do all of this and more.</div><div><br>That's why I'm so excited to offer you my How to talk to anyone webinar.</div><div>This webinar is for people who want to improve the way that they talk and achieve the success and confidence that comes along with that.<br><br><br><br>What you get in the webinar:</div><ul><li>the exact words, body language, and even subtle “connection” strategies to use.</li><li>a roll out strategy - step by step guide for changing the way you interact and developing your own style, 3 challenges</li><li>confidence boosters</li><li>the 3 things you need to know BEFORE you enter the room</li><li>a simple framework so that you'll never be at a loss for words again</li><li>word for word scripts to start / end / engage&nbsp;</li><li><br></li></ul><div><br>topics:</div><ul><li>Focus on Value - Focus on feeling confident about the value you are adding in any given situation.
