      How to stay Motivated

      <div>"Oh my gosh, you do so much! How do you stay motivated?!?"<br><br>The first thing that I look at are my <em>sticking points</em>, that is when am I most likely to get distracted and stop moving towards my goal. Once I identify these sticking points, it is a lot easier for me to develop a strong strategy to safeguard against falling of the horse.<br><br><strong>Sticking Point #1 - Getting Started<br></strong>Seriously, sometimes just getting started can feel like the biggest hurdle in the world. This is especially true for things that I don't want to do (like sweeping the floor), things that make me feel uncomfortable (like going to the dentist), things that seem overwhelming (like writing my thesis) or any number of other things that I want to push aside. Believe me, the human brain can be very creative and generate a full list of ideas and things to do instead of whatever it is you are avoiding. A friend of mine realized that her procrastination had gone too far when she found herself crouched down cleaning behind her toilet with a toothbrush! Yikes! <br><br>With this in mind I work to set myself up for success and focus on just starting. At times, working on the task for just a few minutes is all I can do, and that is totally fine, because the main thing here is to push through the intimidation and fear of starting and just start! More often than not, once I get started, I find that I can usually get into the flow and actually work.<strong><br><br><br>Sticking Point #2 - Staying on task<br></strong>Sometimes I find it incredibly difficult to stay on task. I feel like there are 1000 other things that I can or should be doing. "I bet the plants need watering...how about another cup of coffee? Did I leave the stove on?"<br>At times my thoughts dart and zoom around like honey bees, and I struggle to focus on any one thing. <br>Rather than push through or berate myself, I take this as a clear sign that I need a break - and I take one. Taking a short break can really do wonders to improve focus and concentration. Now, I'm not talking about a long, 3 hour nap, but rather a short 100% detachment from the task I'm working on. The important thing here is to NOT think about the task while on break, so you can come back fresh. <br>Here are a few ideas:<br>-standing up &amp; stretching<br>-taking a short walk (3-10 minutes)<br>-doing some easy exercises, like 10 jumping jacks (this has a double benefit of increasing blood circulation and waking up my brain, if I'm feeling sleepy)<br>-sitting still and taking 3 deep breaths (quickest method to clear your thinking - this works great in situations where you can't get up and leave - taking an exam for example)<br><strong><br>Sticking Point #3 - Overwhelm<br></strong>When there are tasks so long and complicated, or challenges so huge that I just feel like giving up, I know that I'm simply overwhelmed. The good news is that most things can be divided up into smaller more manageable&nbsp;pieces or chunks. So, taking the time to break things down and plan out what to do when can really help, especially if some chucks can even be delegated out!<strong><br>- intimidated- scared&nbsp;</strong></div>
