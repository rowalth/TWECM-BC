      Revealed: Global English and why you need it

      <div>1. English has been called a universal language, right up there with music and mathematics. English is called THE language of business/aviation/technology, the language of opportunity, the world's second language, the list goes on. <br><br>According to statistics, It is the world's #1 second language, one of the largest native languages, the <strong>official language</strong> in 70 countries, and year after year there has been a clear link between a nation's ability to use English and GDP.<br>Speaking English allows you to actually broaden your world, from job opportunities to the ability to relate to people and expand your reach<br><br>2. Global English / international English is the language of SOLVING PROBLEMS<br><br>business English&nbsp; - not just for USA/UK/Australia<br>Taiwan - Japan = common language = English<br><br>Yes, if you want to do business, if you want to take your reach to the next level<br><br>examples-<br>Logistic issues?<br>Environmental concerns?<br>Greta Thunberg - who switched from her native Swedish to English to reach her audience - Check out - Fridays for Future<br><br>Jay Walker - the name behind Priceline &amp; other initiatives that are changing the way we address old problems: "With English you can become part of a wider conversation -- a global conversation about global problems, like climate change or poverty, or hunger or disease." - AND you can be part of the solutions!<br><br> English represents hope for a better future -- a future where the world has a common language to solve common problems. <br><br>Yeah, but that's what translators/ interpreters are for, right?<br><br>3. <br>English is THE key gets YOU at the talking table<br><br>Your face, your ideas - no filter<br><br>even the world's best translator/interpreter CAN'T do<br><br>* oh yeah, and one more thing!<br> So - English is the language for Solving Problems...but what is Global English and how is that different than regular English?<br><br>Maybe you've learned English in school, you might even feel pretty confident having a conversation, or perhaps you are even a NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER...but then suddenly, something crazy, like a phrasal verb pops up - and everything starts to break down...<br><br>A PHRASAL WHAT??<br><br>Let's be honest, most native speakers have no idea what a phrasal verb is - even though we use them ALL THE TIME, and for people who speak English as a second or third language...these are those crazy things that you've probably heard about, but can't quite pin down. <br><br>(see that? I used a phrasal verb there -to pin down (something or someone) or pin something down -which means to find out some information with certainty / clarity )<br><br>To sum up:<br>Global or international English is all about using English as a means of communication and connecting people and ideas in numerous ways, and the movement towards an <strong>international </strong>standard for the <strong>language</strong>.<br><br>So, I welcome you to jump onboard and join the conversation!</div>
