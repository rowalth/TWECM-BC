      6 ways to use charisma to be a stronger leader in your everyday life

      <h1><br></h1><ul><li>Felicia Spahr, Contributor</li><li>29.06.2016, 16:45&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br><br></div><div>Have you ever felt captivated by someone, but had no idea why?<br><br></div><div><strong>It's likely they were being charismatic</strong>. Which means they were able to engage you in a way that made you feel great, making you want to be around that person even more.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>But what is that mysterious quality? And how can more of us have it, even if you're introverted or don't think you're charismatic at all?<br><br></div><div>I remember when I was young, my dad was this charismatic person. We would walk down the street together and suddenly I'd notice he had disappeared. But it was only because he had found strangers to talk to and quickly turn into friends. This happened over and over again until I finally realized I wanted to understand what was going on under the surface.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Because charisma is more than ‘just smile’ and ‘make eye contact.’</strong> And if you want to be able to lead at work, have better relationships, and be able to influence people easily, read on to find out the ‘secret sauce’ of charisma and six ways to use it to be a better leader in your everyday life.<br><br></div><div><a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/use-charisma-to-be-a-better-leader-in-your-everyday-life-2016-6?op=0#/#-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><br>Als Galerie anzeigen<br></a><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>1. Captivate immediately with better questions<br><br></div><div>When's the last time you asked yourself if ‘How are you?’ or ‘How was your weekend?’ got you the kind of responses that led to exciting conversations?<br><br></div><div>We're so used to saying ‘good,’ that it ends the conversation before it even begins. Instead, make a small tweak:<br><br></div><div>All you have to do is use the word ‘what’ instead of ‘how.’<br><br></div><div>‘What did you do this weekend?’ Or ‘What was the most interesting part about your day?’ will get you more detailed responses that lead to a stimulating conversation.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Why?&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>It forces people to think and talk about specifics, which are little hooks that get you out of the dreaded awkward pause and help keep the conversation going.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>2. Deepen the connection without saying a word<br><br></div><div>You know when the conversation is going well and you both laugh at the same joke, or bond over a similar experience?&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The best thing you can do is touch the other person to emphasize the connection.<br><br></div><div>It could mean touching them lightly on the arm, on the knee, or even squeezing their hand if you have a closer friendship.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>But why touch?<br><br></div><div>According to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/05/touching.makes.you.healthier.health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Health.com:</a>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>“Whether it's a squeeze of the hand, a big bear hug, a kneading massage, even a bedroom romp, touch is shaping up to be the ultimate mind-body medicine.<br><br></div><div>“From lowering blood pressure and heart rate to increasing immune function and relieving pain, getting touched or doing some touching makes you healthier — not to mention happier and less anxious.”<br><br></div><div>And not only that, touching the other person makes you stand out and position you as someone they associate with feeling good.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>3. Make them feel like you're one of them&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>A lot of advice about charisma focuses on mirroring, which is mimicking the other person’s body language and behavior in order to make people feel like you're ‘one of them.’<br><br></div><div>If you take a step further, you can focus on mimicking the other person’s language: the words they use and how they describe things can become the words you use and how you describe things.<br><br></div><div>Most people don't do this because they worry about coming across as fake or inauthentic. But the right way to do it is to mimic a phrase or words that you actually like!<br><br></div><div>For example, I was in a group training and someone kept saying ‘I’d like to make a friendly amendment’ whenever he wanted to suggest a change to what we were doing. I loved the phrase and saw it work well in the group, so I decided to use it, too. Since I was being playful, it only strengthened the bond between us and showed I respected his perspective.<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>4. Mesmerize with stories<br><br></div><div>In an article from <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/why-your-brain-loves-good-storytelling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Harvard Business Review about the power of storytelling</a>, they talk about how telling stories not only motivates people but helps them recall information even weeks later.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Because of that, it’s so important to remember that talking about ‘the facts’ rarely moves our hearts.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>When you tell engaging stories, people remember and act on what you say, which makes you seem even more influential and persuasive.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>But what stories to tell?<br><br></div><div><strong>It’s simple: </strong>Tell stories to illustrate an idea, and that are relevant to who you're talking to. Explain an idea to the CFO with a story that uses numbers. Talk about perseverance to a sports team with a story about a sports icon. They don’t have to be long, either. Just enough to get the point across!<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>5. Make the other person feel special by holding your gaze<br><br></div><div>There's nothing worse than getting the impression someone isn’t listening to you than seeing their eyes shift around the room when you’re talking.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>If you do that to someone, you're basically telling them that they're not important or worthy of your attention. This is why charisma is about more than ‘eye contact’ — it's about keeping it!<br><br></div><div>How to be successful with this is by refocusing your attention on the other person no matter what distractions are around. If you feel yourself checking out, refocus. If you’re thinking about your to-do list, refocus. Because the alternative is that person telling others: ‘She doesn’t really listen or seem to care about me,’ which decreases your power and status.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>6. Attract people with a calm, composed demeanor&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>If you’ve ever observed the body language of powerful people, you’ll notice that they rarely fidget or seem nervous. They come off as calm, cool, and collected even if they feel uncertain or scared beneath the surface.<br><br></div><div>What’s so important about this is playing with your hair, fidgeting, and moving around makes other people feel anxious and kills your charisma. But if you ‘act as if’ — by staying still — people assume you’re in control and trust that you’ve got it handled.<br><br></div><div>Most importantly, charisma is much more than a few simple tactics — it’s an entire experience someone has with you. From how you dress, to your tone of voice, to your handshake, every detail must be accounted for as if you were running a Michelin star restaurant in order for charisma to truly have its effect and work to lead, influence, and inspire others.<br><br></div><div><a href="http://felicia-spahr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Felicia Spahr</em></a><em> is a sought-out expert who ambitious, professional women go to when they want to become better leaders.<br></em><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div></div>
