      <div><strong>Creating the Time You Need to Do the Things You Love</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Time is at a premium these days. It’s hard to find someone that complains about having too much time on their hands. <strong>Most of us are so busy with work, family, and various obligations, there’s little time left to do the things we’d really want to do!</strong></div><div><br>While talking with a close friend of mine about our plans for the summer, she screamed "I don't want to sort any more ?@#%$ socks!" With a successful career and three small children, there were 653 other things she wanted to do with her time instead of dealing with the never ending flow of unsorted socks.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</div><div>It’s not always easy to find time to pursue your passions, but if you’re serious, there’s usually a way.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Use these techniques to cut through the noise of life and create the time for what you value:&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br></div><ol><li><strong>Decide what you want to create space for.</strong> The best way to motivate yourself to create more free time in your life is to identify what you want to make time for! What are the most important things you’d like to spend more time on? Do you want to learn the violin? Spend more time with your with your children?&nbsp;<br><br><ul><li><strong>I</strong>magine that you already have a block of free time. Figure out how you’d spend that extra time and make sure you have some good reasons. Create a list of reasons that trigger you emotionally. Or to use the words of Marie Kondo, what sparks joy? In this case, we are looking for inspiration and being logical is unlikely to push you to make value driven changes.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Use your mornings wisely.</strong> Most people waste their mornings. Honestly, they stay in bed as long as possible and barely manage to get to work on time each day. If you are looking for more time, be intentional and make the most of your mornings. This is one of the quickest tactics to get unstuck and break out of your routine.<br><br></li></ol><ul><li><strong>It’s often easier to do something worthwhile in the morning than in the evening.</strong> What are you missing by going to bed earlier? Probably not a lot.<strong><br>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><ol><li><strong>Understand the ways you waste time.</strong> Take a honest look at your day. As humans, we’re quite ingenious at wasting time. Watch yourself for a day and write down all the ways you waste time. When you understand where your time is leaking away, you can start working on clear solutions.<br><br></li><li><strong>Make a schedule.</strong> A schedule can keep you on track and help to ensure that your time is being spent wisely. A schedule can help to minimize the amount of time you waste. You can also build time into your schedule to do the things you enjoy the most.<br><br></li><li><strong>Delegate.</strong> Create more time for yourself by utilizing the people and resources around you. This is true both at work and at home. Although it may often feel like you are the only people who can tick the items off your lengthy to-do list, there’s a good chance that others can help. Put your employees, coworkers, children, and partner to work! <strong>A little help can free up quite a lot of time.</strong><br><br></li><li><strong>Prioritize and eliminate.</strong> Perhaps you just have too many non-essential things going on in your life. It might be time to cut back on a few of those obligations.<br><br></li></ol><ul><li>Take a look at everything you have to do each day/week/month and think about how much value those things add to your life. You can probably find something to remove or at least put off temporarily.<br><br></li><li>Consider making a Don't Do List. Similar to a typical to-do list, this list contains all of the tasks and activities that could or should be done, but you intentionally chose NOT to do them. In the case of my friend above, 'sorting socks' is at the very top of her Don't Do List. Maybe someone else in the family will do it, maybe they will start buying only one color socks or maybe everyone will wear unmatched socks. It doesn't matter, the main point is that the time and mental energy she spent on what for her was a non-essential task, sorting socks, is now available for more important things, like talking to me :)</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Multitask.</strong> Multitasking sometimes helps. You can spend more quality time with your children while gardening. Or stay up to date on industry news by reading articles during your morning commute. Finding activities that work well together can help you feel more productive. Be mindful of over tasking yourself, or stretching yourself too thin. Making important business calls while sitting on an exercise bike or going through emails during a business meeting tends to be counter productive.</li></ol><div><br></div><div>You can find time if you have a good enough reason! <strong>Determine what you want to create time for and make it happen.</strong> Think about time in a new way. Delegate, schedule, eliminate to find more available time pockets and avoid wasting time. It’s been said that the average life is plenty long enough, provided you don’t waste any time. What are you willing to give up to spend time on the things you love?<br><br><bc-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIuZ2lkOi8vYmMzL0F0dGFjaG1lbnQvMTMwMDIyNzI1P2V4cGlyZXNfaW4GOwBUSSIMcHVycG9zZQY7AFRJIg9hdHRhY2hhYmxlBjsAVEkiD2V4cGlyZXNfYXQGOwBUMA==--c047b09efc6ff07896d8b038e13383aedd4198ad" content-type="application/pdf" url="https://preview.3.basecamp.com/3103412/blobs/8a7e8a9a-a235-11e9-96fd-a0369f740fe3/previews/full" href="https://storage.3.basecamp.com/3103412/blobs/8a7e8a9a-a235-11e9-96fd-a0369f740fe3/download/Creating%20The%20Time%20You%20Need%20To%20Do%20The%20Things%20You%20Love.pdf" filename="Creating The Time You Need To Do The Things You Love.pdf" filesize="317086" width="1224" height="1584" previewable="true"><div class="attachment attachment--pdf attachment--pdf attachment--preview attachment--exported">
