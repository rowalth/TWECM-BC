      The 4 Common Objections Crusher Email: Sales Email #7
      
    </h1>

      <div><br><em>Note from Raelyn: No matter which niche you are in, your subscribers will likely be experiencing 1 or more of these 4 common sales objections. They are, “I can’t afford this”, “I don’t have time”, “I have no confidence in myself that I can do this”, and “Now’s not the right time”. Amazing how sales objections can be universal, right? You most definitely would have faced these objections multiple times in your life when you bought various products and services. As an online business owner, I face these objections on a daily basis and it is our job as business owners to help our potential customers navigate out of these objections that stop them from taking that leap of faith to purchase.</em><br><em>In this email, I provide a template for you to directly address these 4 top objections head-on. Of course, you can replace the objections with niche-specific objections too. Let’s crush these objections!</em><strong>Subject Line: The 4 Secret Fears That's Keeping You Back</strong><br><strong>Email Copy:</strong><br>Hey [first name],<br>After talking to a couple of [Course Name] students, I have realized that all of them had to get over at least 1 or more of 4 major fears before they took the leap to invest in themselves.<br>Today, many of them have [accomplished end goal], completely transforming their [business/health/life/ etc] in the process.<br>I've been talking a lot about [Course Name] and it just occurred to me... you might be hesitant to enroll because of some of these secret fears.<br>Hence, I see it as my duty to help you process and get past these same fears that many of my students had as well, so that you too will go from [where they are now] to [where they want to be].<br>Stop [whatever they are doing now - e.g. googling for information], and start [what they should be doing].<br><strong>Common Fear #1: "I can't afford it"</strong><br>How much is [end goal] worth to your [life/business/etc]?<br>[Explain how this end goal is worth so much more than the price you are charging]<br><em>(E.g.

[link to sales page]<br><strong>Common Fear #3: "I have no confidence in myself"</strong><br>Here’s the thing.

[link to sales<br>page]<br><strong>Common Fear #4: "Now's not the right time"</strong><br>If not now, then when?<br>I'll tell you why NOW is the BEST time to join [Course Name]: The price of [Course Name] will<br>be increasing by [#]% in [#] hours.<br>You will also have lifetime access to the course, so you can come back to this course whenever<br>it's convenient for you.<br>Also, one small step at a time, [first name]!<br>No matter how busy you are, it is much better to do something small every day (as long as it's in the right direction), than to do NOTHING at all and wait for the "perfect" time.<br><strong>Are you a bit shocked that I know your secret fears so well?</strong><br>Don’t worry — I’m not spying on you!
