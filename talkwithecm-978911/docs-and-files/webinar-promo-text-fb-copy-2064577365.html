      <ul><li>I was tired of feeling awkward / stupid.</li><li>I was sick of feeling stupid.</li><li>I used to get so irritated when people asked about the gap in my CV, now it's my <em>favorite </em>question!</li></ul><div>"I used to get so irritated when people asked about the gap in my CV, now it's my favorite question!"&nbsp;<br><br>What if you could talk to anyone, anytime, anywhere using the power of body language to create an instant connection?<br><br>Listen to this woman, "I was so tired of feeling stupid. I really wanted to get out of 'baby world' and get back to my career...but after months of diapers and bottles, I didn't know how to start. When I went to my first networking event, I felt awkward. I said the wrong things at the wrong time and people would just stare. It was awful!"&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>It is not only about networking events. How many of us have felt this way when getting ready for an interview? Or even when making a presentation making a presentation at work?<br><br>Although the situations change, the story is the same: Unlike the 'naturals' who always seen to know exactly the right things to say, when we say something, it comes out completely wrong. Or worse - we don't say anything at all.<br><br>If there is anything worse than saying the wrong things, it is saying nothing at all and being forgettable.&nbsp;<br><br>Whether getting ready for an interview, giving a presentation at work, or looking to connect with new people - it feels so good when you know exactly what to do. I'm talking about all those nitty-gritty details like where to stand, how to make good eye contact, who talks first, what to say and all those things that can get in the way of really connecting. <br><br>I'd like show you how to do all of this and more, join me for my free webinar here -&nbsp;</div><div></div>
