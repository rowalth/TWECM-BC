(intro to their CTA)&nbsp;<br></em><br></div><div><br>Step #3 Set up your affiliate program and contest (optional).<br><br></div><div>Setting up an affiliate contest for your virtual summit is a tactic I hadn’t seen used before, and one to which Chandler attributes a large part of his first summit’s success.<br><br></div><div>If you are unsure what an affiliate program or contest is, <a href="https://videofruit.com/blog/launch-plan-affiliate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">go read this article.&nbsp;<br></a><br></div><div>Let’s break apart what an affiliate contest for a summit looks like and how you can create one for yourself.<br><br></div><div><strong>What is an affiliate contest?<br></strong><br></div><div>An affiliate is basically someone who promotes on your behalf, usually for some kind of monetary benefit. In Chandler’s case, he reached out to individuals with lists larger than his own to send leads to his summit. He enticed the affiliates with a contest with big prizes in agreement for their promotion.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #1: Decide on your prizes.<br></strong><br></div><div>Your budget will obviously determine your prizes. If you do the work ahead of time, you may even be able to find sponsors for your prizes. Here are a few of the prizes and incentives Chandler offered to his affiliates:<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://videofruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/prizes-804x1024.png" width="804" height="1024"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #2: Create the terms for your affiliate program and design a landing page.<br></strong><br></div><div>You want the terms of your affiliate program to be fair for every participant. That’s why Chandler chose the structure of prizes and affiliate incentives that he did.<br><br></div><div>The best way for you to see what can be offered in an affiliate contest is to check out his landing page. It has all the details of the program spelled out.<br><br></div><div>Click <a href="https://self-publishingschool.com/affiliates-area/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> to view the full affiliate page with all the contest and incentive details.<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://videofruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/affiliate-area-606x1024.png" width="606" height="1024"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #3: Write email copy / communication schedule for affiliates.<br></strong><br></div><div>You’ll want to pre-write the emails that you will ask your affiliates to send out. It’s easiest to include these all in a Google document and send them out to affiliates to use as templates.<br><br></div><div>Since your affiliates are going to have three months to promote your summit, we recommend providing at least 10 emails that they can send out to their audiences about your summit launch.<br><br></div><div>As you create custom social media images, banners, and other promotional tools for your summit, you can send these along to your affiliates as well.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #4: Reach out to potential affiliates.<br></strong><br></div><div>It’s time to reach out to your potential affiliates!<br><br></div><div>Who makes a good affiliate?<br><br></div><div>Anyone with a list size similar to or bigger than your own!<br><br></div><div>Think about who will actually mail the information out to a significant part of their list and who will send high-quality leads your way that will convert into paying customers.<br><br></div><div>Many of your affiliates may also end up being your speakers, and that’s ok. You can reach out to them at the same time about becoming a speaker and becoming an affiliate for the summit.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #5: Organize your contest.<br></strong><br></div><div>Lastly, you’ll want to make sure that your affiliate contest is set up through an affiliate management tool.<br><br></div><div>Chandler used Infusionsoft. (You can use <a href="https://samcart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SamCart</a>). The process included creating the contact in Infusionsoft, signing them up as an affiliate and sending them their unique affiliate link (all created by Infusionsoft). Once an affiliate signs up, you will send them their unique log-in information to the portal to track their affiliate sales.<br><br></div><div>A few last tips if you choose to run an affiliate contest for your summit:<br><br></div><div>• Have a leaderboard update that goes out daily to all affiliates so they can see how they are ranking against other affiliates.<br>• Personally reach out to all top affiliate performers.<br>• Take care of your affiliates. If one emails you, make sure you respond within 24 hours.<br>• Hire a qualified affiliate manager oversee this project, as there is a lot of work that goes into it.<br><br></div><h1>Phase #2: Recruiting and Creating Assets</h1><div>There are 3 major things to focus on in Phase #2 of hosting your virtual summit.<br><br></div><div>Step #1: Recruit your speakers.<br>Step #2: Interview your speakers.<br>Step #3: Create assets for the summit.<br><br></div><div>Here is a basic outline of what this phase will look like:<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://videofruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/blog-graphs__2__key-7.png" width="763" height="561"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><br>Step #1 Recruit your speakers.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #1: Start recruiting speakers.<br></strong><br></div><div>Stuff is about to get real.<br><br></div><div>Now it’s time to recruit your speakers. That means you’re going to personally reach out to every person on your <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iBAbavrnW8eukR5mWhFMuEkuS9fi5j9zycZ1W_tn27c/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Speaker Spreadsheet </a>and individually invite them to join in on your summit.<br><br></div><div>Make these conversations as personal as possible. If you are able to jump on a Skype or phone call with the person, do that. You also want to make sure to cover certain topics during your chat. Here’s a list of what you should cover:<br><br></div><div>• Add a personal note or greeting. (Make these as personal as possible!)<br>• What the summit will be about<br>• What the summit’s dates will be<br>• What you would like for them to speak on<br>• Why you want THEM to be the person to speak on this topic<br>• How the interview process will work<br>• Give them a few dates / times that you would like to interview them.<br>• “Please respond to this email and let us know if you would like to participate.”<br>• “Here’s where you can schedule your call:” (Give them a link. )<br><br></div><div><strong>Here’s an example email for you:<br></strong><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://videofruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Inbox__2__-_abbey_videofruit_com_-_Videofruit_Mail.png" width="992" height="516"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div>This is just a basic script. I definitely recommend NOT copying it word for word. Use it as a guide to craft your email.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #2: Follow up with each non-answer.<br></strong><br></div><div>Make sure you keep track of the speakers that you reach out to and their responses. Use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iBAbavrnW8eukR5mWhFMuEkuS9fi5j9zycZ1W_tn27c/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Speaker Spreadsheet </a>we’ve created to help you do this.<br><br></div><div>Your main goal during this month is to conduct all of your speaker interviews. That means you’ll need to follow up with those speakers who don’t respond to your initial outreach. Try reaching out every 5 business days until you get a response.<br><br></div><div>Make sure you are keeping track of all the interviews that get scheduled and that you have them in your own calendar as well.<br><br></div><div><strong>If they say no to an interview:<br></strong><br></div><div>Like I mentioned earlier, you will likely have to reach out to 100+ people if you want to get 30+ speakers for your event. That means you’ll be getting a lot of “Nos.”<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>Even if a potential speaker says “no,” they may be willing to promote your summit or become an affiliate.<br><br></div><div>You’re going to have to use tact with this. If they seem incredibly uninterested, it may be best just to thank them for their time and move on.<br><br></div><div>If they seem really disappointed that they are unable to participate, or if they show some level of interest in the summit, it may be worth asking them if they can promote.<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://videofruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Inbox__2__-_abbey_thevirtualsavvy_com_-_The_Virtual_Savvy_Mail.png" width="958" height="167"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><strong>If they say yes to an interview:<br></strong><br></div><div>Congrats! You’ve booked a speaker to interview for your summit!<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>Follow-up is key here. Once a speaker agrees to be interviewed for your summit:<br><br></div><div>• Make sure they schedule a time to be interviewed.<br>• Send them the speaker checklist.<br>• Emphasize that you will need all the items on the speaker checklist sent to you by the interview.<br>• Come up with individual questions that you will ask the speaker and add them to your general questions. Email these questions to the speaker.<br>• Set up calendar reminders for the interview to be sent out three days before and the morning of the interview.<br>• Ask if there is there anyone else they know of who would be interested in this opportunity.<br><br></div><div><br>Step #2 Record your interviews.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #1: Record your interviews.<br></strong><br></div><div>Once you start booking your speakers, you’ll need to make sure that you are on track to record your interviews and get them ready for your summit.<br><br></div><div>The day of your interview with each speaker, make sure to do the following:<br><br></div><div>• Test audio and video quality before getting on the call.<br>• Chat with the speaker for a couple of minutes before starting the interview.<br>• Triple-check that the call is being recorded.<br>• Conduct the interview and then thank the speaker for their time.<br>• Tell them what their next steps are / how they can promote the summit.<br>• Check off in your spreadsheet that you have interviewed them.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #2: Record your keynote speech.<br></strong><br></div><div>The keynote speech is the last interview of the summit. It’s your closing speech where you will recap highlights of the summit, teach on the primary topic of the summit, and then promote your primary product at the end.<br><br></div><div>Once you are in full-on summit mode, it’s going to be a bit crazy to plan your own keynote speech, so it’s a good idea to get this done ahead of time.<br><br></div><div><br>Step #3: Create graphics, banners, and promotional tools.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #1: Create graphics and banners.<br></strong><br></div><div>The sooner you are able to start creating graphics to promote your summit, the better.<br><br></div><div>These graphics will be used on your website, sent to your speakers and affiliates, used on social media, and used in paid advertising for your virtual summit.<br><br></div><div>Your graphics should include:<br><br></div><div>• Top or big-name speakers<br>• The summit’s name<br>• The summit’s theme (i.e, What will attendees walk away with?)<br>• A call-to-action (e.g., “Get Your Free Ticket Now!”)<br><br></div><div>If you have never created graphics before, you might want to hire a designer to take care of this for you.<br><br></div><div>You can hire someone off <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fiverr</a> (low-end) to help.

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><br>Step #4 Develop initial landing and thank-you pages.<br><br></div><div>Your ultimate goal is to start promoting your summit (via your list, you speaker’s lists, your affiliate’s lists, and paid social media advertising) for a full month before your summit begins.<br><br></div><div>To start promoting, you’ll need a landing page and a thank-you page created to capture the sign-ups for your summit.<br><br></div><div>This is what you’re going to do during this step.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #1: Create your landing page.<br></strong><br></div><div>A landing page is a simple page that will promote your summit and capture email sign-ups for those who want to attend.<br><br></div><div>Chandler created a custom landing page using WordPress, but you can also use a drag-and-drop page creator like <a href="https://videofruit.com/leadpages-buy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LeadPages</a>.<br><br></div><div><strong>What should your landing page include?<br></strong><br></div><div>• Summit’s name and dates<br>• Summit’s theme (what attendees will walk away with)<br>• Top speakers<br>• Video explaining the summit<br>• Compelling Images that show off what the attendee will learn<br>• FAQs<br>• A sign-up form integrated with your email service provider<br><br></div><div>This is the FIRST page that you will want to create. It’s best to create it as soon as you are able to, and then make changes if needed. The sooner you have a landing page, the sooner you can get people to sign up for your summit.<br><br></div><div>Don’t wait until you have every speaker booked and a perfect page created. Put together a basic landing page and then update it as you gain more high-influencer speakers.<br><br></div><div><strong>Example:<br></strong><br></div><div>Here’s an example of Chandler’s landing page for his 2016 Self-Publishing Success Summit.

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #2: Create your thank-you page.<br></strong><br></div><div>The thank-you page is the page that your attendees will see directly after they sign up for your virtual summit.<br><br></div><div>The absolute BEST thing to here is to have your thank-you page be a sales page for your all-access pass.<br><br></div><div>The person who visits this page is obviously already interested in your topic, so this is a perfect time to upsell them on your all-access pass.<br><br></div><div>You can also choose to have a regular thank-you page here, which includes information on the summit and what they should do next. (However, you’re probably really missing out if you choose this!).<br><br></div><div><strong>What should your thank-you page include?<br></strong><br></div><div>If you are going to promote your all-access pass on your thank-you page, it should include:<br><br></div><div>• A “thank-you” for joining the summit<br>• Notification that an email was sent with summit details<br>• Encourage attendees to add your email address to their contacts.<br>• Remind them of the summit’s dates, and that all interviews will be available for 48-72 hours (whatever you have chosen).<br>• Information on how to purchase an all-access pass for the virtual summit<br><br></div><div><strong>Example:<br></strong><br></div><div>Here’s an example of Chandler’s thank-you page for his 2016 Self-Publishing Success Summit.

</figure></bc-attachment></div><h1>Phase #3: Developing and promoting</h1><div>There are 3 major things to focus on in Phase #3 of hosting your virtual summit.<br><br></div><div>Step #1: Set up your PPC campaign.<br>Step #2: Create your individual speaker pages.<br>Step #3 Quality control everything.<br><br></div><div>Here is a basic outline of what this phase will look like:<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://videofruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/blog-graphs__2__key-10.png" width="711" height="525"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><br>Step #1 Promote through paid advertising.<br><br></div><div>One of the key ways that Chandler was able to get the word out about his virtual summit was through the use of paid advertising. Mainly, Facebook ads.<br><br></div><div>You will want to complete this step <em>at least</em> one month before your summit starts.<br><br></div><div>While we won’t exhaust all the the details of running paid advertising (if you are completely new to running Facebook ads, hiring help may be worth it), here are some of the basics:<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #1: Choose your ad campaign’s objective.<br></strong><br></div><div>When you first start your Facebook ad campaign, you’ll be prompted to choose an objective for your ad. Choose “Website Conversions.” You’ll then need to make sure that you have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/www/952192354843755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a Facebook pixel </a>applied to your landing page to track conversions.<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://videofruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/facebookad.png" width="684" height="438"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">
  <img src="https://videofruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/facebookad.png" width="684" height="438">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #2: Choose your budget.<br></strong><br></div><div>You can choose a daily budget or a lifetime budget. The choice is up to you and what you can afford. You are going to be keeping track of your ad and making sure it is converting well as you go along, so it might be good to start with a smaller budget and then raise it as the ad does well.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #3: Write your ad.<br></strong><br></div><div>As you write your ad, remember your target audience. What is the end result that your attendees will get when joining the summit? Include that in your advertising.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #4: Choose an image.<br></strong><br></div><div>At this point, you already should have a few graphics created for your Facebook ad. Facebook allows you to test multiple pictures for your ad, which we highly recommend doing. Testing multiple versions of your text and images is one of the best things you can do to improve your ad’s effectiveness.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #5: Choose ad placement.<br></strong><br></div><div>When placing your ad, you’ll have three choices for where it will appear: the News Feed, via Mobile, or on the right column. We recommend testing out each of these three and then, after a few days, removing the placement that isn’t working well. Also, remember to make sure your landing page is extremely mobile-friendly when you choose the mobile option.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #6: Choose ad targeting.<br></strong><br></div><div>Ad targeting may be the single most important part of your Facebook ad. This is how you determine who will actually see your ad.<br><br></div><div>If you already have a large email subscriber list, you may want to choose the “Custom Audience” target. You’ll be able to upload your list, and even create a lookalike audience based on your list’s key features.<br><br></div><div>If you don’t have an existing list, the best way to target your audience is through interests. You can specifically target people who are interested in a certain topic. We recommend choosing an individual or company who is an influencer in your niche. For instance, in the online marketing world, you might choose someone like Pat Flynn, Seth Godin, or Tim Ferris.<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://videofruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ads_Manager.png" width="647" height="259"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><br>Step #2 Develop your inside pages.<br><br></div><div>Once your Facebook ad is running, it’s time to get to work developing your summit’s inside pages.<br><br></div><div>Here are the pages you’ll need and the different elements that should be included:<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #1: Check your landing &amp; thank-you pages.<br></strong><br></div><div>Congrats: You’ve already created these!<br><br></div><div>You’ll probably want to check on your pages to make sure they are updated. Have any new key speakers been added? Update your landing page accordingly.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #2: Create a sales page with an order form.<br></strong><br></div><div><em>What it is</em>: Your sales page is the page for the product you’ve decided to pitch at your summit’s end.

An individual page for an individual speaker is a very simple page, and the primary goal is for people to have an easy place to watch the interview.

These pages need to be password-protected so only those attendees who purchase your premium pass can view them.<br><br></div><div><em>Your membership site should include the following concepts:<br><br></em><br></div><div>• Sections: Since Chandler and his team organized their summit into sections (writing, marketing, and publishing), the membership site and interviews were organized into these sections as well.<br>• You will publish the speaker pages here as well. These can look like the pages you designed earlier that host the speaker videos. The only difference is that these pages will stay on the membership site for life, while the other speaker pages will be removed after 24-72 hours (whatever time you have decided to make the videos available).<br>• Make sure that there is a link to the speaker’s CTA under each of the videos.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Action Item #8: Create a membership Facebook Group.<br></strong><br></div><div><em>What it is: </em>One of the key features that Chandler set up for those who purchased his summit’s all-access pass was a private Facebook community.
