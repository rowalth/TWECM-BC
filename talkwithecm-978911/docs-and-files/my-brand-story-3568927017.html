You're driven by passion and have big dreams - you're a visionary with big plans!</strong><br><br>You spend your day seeing back to back clients, hurrying from one appointment to the next, but with only so many hours in the day, you feel like your work is only just scratching the surface and there are so many more people you want to reach. <br><br><strong>Right now your days are filled with tasks and to-do lists that inch you closer to your goal. The people who know you love what you do, but it is so difficult to convince others to see your value. Their eyes gloss over, they don't get it, and sometimes you don't even really want to bother. Maybe you have new ideas you want to explore...Maybe you see others growing their career, exploding their success with lower quality skills and less experience than you have...Maybe you have the desire to do something entirely new, but you're just not sure how to start. With only so many hours in the day, you feel stretched entirely too thin and in weak moments you question if you should even try. </strong><br><br>If you’re really honest with yourself, it feels like you’re stuck on a hamster wheel and you know there has got to be a better way. You see glimpses of your tired and anxious face when you look in the mirror, you feel the knot in the pit of your stomach as you lie awake at night. And, if something doesn’t change?

In 2015, I realised the way we Nats were working, well...it just wasn’t working. It seemed like our industry had been frozen in time and we were still operating from an archaic paradigm that no longer served us. And, so I decided to make it my mission to break free from business as usual and create a new model - one that would set my soul on fire, see my work reach thousands of women and create extraordinary transformation for my clients. Today, I run sold-out retreats, masterminds and events and I show other wellness business owners how to do the same.

      <div><strong>Hi there go-getter! If you're here reading this, I guess that you're driven by passion and have big dreams - not the usual oh-hum dreams, but really fantastic, uniquely you dreams!</strong><br><br>You have great ideas, and you are ready to reach out, but it seems like as soon as you say it out loud, there is always someone there to shoot it down. The idea of building it up and getting people onboard seems impossible. So, you keep a lot of things inside. Sometimes you feel stuck, not even sure how to strike up a conversation or what you should even say. M<strong>oving everything online hasn't helped much either. <br>When you start to talk, you can see eyeballs gloss over, or the people listening just don't get it, and sometimes you just don't feel like saying anything at all. <br><br>Small talk feels so painful. <br><br>The very idea of reaching out and trying to get others to say yes and supporting your project or idea is overwhelming, and in weak moments you question if you should even try. </strong><br><br><strong>If you're really honest with yourself, sometimes it feels like you're trapped in a hamster wheel, running as fast as you can, but not really moving forward at the end of the day. Deep in your heart, you know that you have real value to offer, but you feel invisible. Maybe you see glimpses of your tired and frustrated face when you look in the mirror, or the dread in the pit of your stomach as you lie awake at night...and, if something doesn't change? How much longer can this go on?

I knew I had to make a change, for her, for me, for all of us. </strong><br><br><strong>I hated not really being seen or recognized for my hard work - I was the invisible coach. My business felt like an expensive hobby, and worse I didn't know how to really connect with people online. I was sick and tired of watching others succeed while I felt stuck just sitting on the sidelines, waiting and wondering if my turn would ever come. </strong><br><br><strong>So, I decided to jump into game, crack the code and create a new system - one that would set my soul on fire, enable me to authentically reach thousands of people and unlock extraordinary transformations for my clients.&nbsp; I made it my mission to break the curse of "not enough," smash the myth of "just work harder," and today I show others how to do the same. In fact, over 1000 people have benefited from my trainings and guidance and now feel the freedom of speaking out, making meaningful connections and living life on their own terms. </strong><br><br><strong>If you want to feel that spark of speaking out, having your contributions valued, and getting to YES OR attracting attention, impressing your audience and kicking imposter syndrome to the curb - you can get step by step support and start making meaningful connections the easy way.
