You're a capable communicator, but you sometimes experience communication problems. It is time to take a closer look at your strengths and weaknesses. Think about your approach to communication, and focus on listening to &amp; reading messages effectively, as well as sending them. This will help you improve. <br><br>(happy dolphin) <span style="background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);">56-75</span> | <span style="background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);">Excellent!

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div>During this process, the person who initiates the communication is the source. This person encodes the communication into a message, and transmits it through a channel. The receiver decodes the message, and, in one way or another, feeds back his or her understanding or a lack of understanding to the source.<br><br></div><div>By understanding the different steps in the process, you can become more aware of your role in it, recognize what you need to do to communicate effectively, anticipate problems before they happen, and improve your overall ability to communicate effectively. In other words, you can more easily access your personal strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Take a look at the sections below help you begin examining your own patterns, and improve the way that you communicate at each stage of the communication process.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>The Source - Planning Your Message<br></strong><br></div><div>(Questions 2, 11)<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>Before you start communicating, take a moment to figure out what you want to say, and why. Don't waste your time conveying information that isn't necessary – and don't waste the listener or reader's time either. Too often, people just keep talking or keep writing – because they think that by saying more, they'll surely cover all the points. Often, however, all they do is confuse or even bore the people they're talking to. Don't be one of those people that just go on and on and on...be aware of your audience and plan your message.<br><br></div><div>To <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/CommunicationsPlanning.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>plan your communication</strong></a> :<br><br></div><ul><li>Understand your objective. Why are you communicating?</li><li>Understand your audience. With whom are you communicating? What do they need to know?</li><li>Plan what you want to say, and how you'll send the message. What is the key information? Which communication channel is best?</li><li>Seek feedback on how well your message was received.</li></ul><div>When you do this, you'll be able to craft a message that will be received positively by your audience.<br><br></div><div>Some people use the <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/KeepItSimple.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>KISS</strong></a> principle ("Keep It Simple and Straightforward"). They know that less is often more, and that good communication should be efficient as well as effective.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Encoding – Creating a Clear, Well-Crafted Message<br></strong><br></div><div>(Questions 1, 5, 8, 10, 15)<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>When you know what you want to say, decide exactly how you'll say it. You're responsible for sending a message that's clear and concise. To achieve this, you need to consider not only what you'll say, but also how you think the recipient will perceive it.<br><br></div><div>We often focus on the message that we want to send, and the way in which we'll send it. But if our message is delivered without considering the other person's perspective, it's likely that part of that message will be lost. To communicate more effectively:<br><br></div><ul><li>Understand what you truly need and want to say. What are the truly essential pieces?</li><li>Anticipate the other person's reaction to your message. What emotional or cultural things could be involved?</li><li>Choose words and body language that allow the other person to really hear what you're saying. Be aware of potential blocks or limitations - time, language level, power imbalances, etc.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>With <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/WritingSkills.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>written communication</strong></a> , make sure that what you write will be perceived the way you intend. Words on a page generally have no tone of voice or emotion – they don't "smile" or "frown" at you while you're reading them (unless you're a very talented writer, of course!)<br><br></div><div>When writing, take time to do the following:<br><br></div><ul><li>Review your style.</li><li>Avoid <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/JargonBusting.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>jargon</strong></a> or slang.</li><li>Check your grammar and punctuation. Sloppy or careless writing will not help convey your message.</li><li>Check also for tone, attitude, nuance, and other subtleties. If you think the message may be misunderstood, it probably will. Take the time to clarify it!</li><li>If there is one, familiarize yourself with your company's writing policies.</li></ul><div>Another important consideration is to use pictures, charts, and diagrams wherever appropriate. As the saying goes, "<strong>A picture is worth a thousand words</strong>." What better way to quickly and clearly communicate an idea than with an image?<br><br></div><div>Also, whether you speak or write your message, consider the <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_66.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>cultural context</strong></a> . If there's potential for miscommunication or misunderstanding due to cultural or language barriers, address these issues in advance.&nbsp;</div><div><strong><br>Choosing the Right Channel<br></strong><br></div><div>(Questions 7, 11, 13)<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>Along with encoding the message, you need to choose the best communication channel to use to send it. You want to be efficient, and yet make the most of everyone's time.<br><br></div><div>Using email to send simple directions is practical. However, if you want to delegate a complex task, an email will probably just lead to more questions. Therefore it may be best to arrange a time to speak in person, that could mean face to face, video call, or a phone call. If your communication has any sensitive or negative emotional content, you may want to stay away from email! Taking time to communicate face to face or by phone, will better help you judge the impact of your words and adjust as needed.<br><br></div><div>When considering the best way to send a message, consider the following:<br><br></div><ul><li>The sensitivity and emotional content of the subject.</li><li>How easy it is to communicate detail.</li><li>The receiver's preferences.</li><li>Time constraints.</li><li>The need to ask and answer questions.</li></ul><div><strong><br>Decoding – Receiving and Interpreting a Message<br></strong><br></div><div>(Questions 3, 6, 12, 14)<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>It can be easy to focus on speaking; we want to make sure that we get our points out there, because many of us find speaking more difficult. However, to be a great communicator, you also need to step back, let the other person talk, and fully focus on listening.<br><br></div><div>This doesn't mean that you should be passive. Listening is actually hard work, which is why effective listening is called <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/ActiveListening.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>active listening</strong></a> . To listen actively, give your undivided attention to the speaker:<br><br></div><ul><li>Look at the person.</li><li>Pay attention to his or her body language.</li><li>Avoid distractions.</li><li>Nod and smile to acknowledge points.</li><li>Occasionally think back and reflect on what the person has said.</li><li>Allow the person to speak, without being distracted by what you'll say next.</li><li>Don't interrupt.</li><li>Ask questions when appropriate.</li></ul><div><a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/EmphaticListening.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Empathic listening</strong></a> also helps you decode a message accurately. To understand a message fully, you have to understand the emotions and underlying feelings the speaker is expressing. This is where an understanding of <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/Body_Language.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>body language</strong></a>&nbsp; can be useful.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Feedback<br></strong><br></div><div>(Questions 4, 9)<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>You need feedback, because without it, you can't be sure that people have understood your message. Sometimes feedback is verbal, and sometimes it's not. We've looked at the importance of asking questions and listening carefully. However, feedback through <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/Body_Language.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>body language</strong></a>&nbsp; is perhaps the most important source of clues to the effectiveness of your communication. By watching the facial expressions, gestures, and even the posture of the person you're communicating with, you can spot:<br><br></div><ul><li>Confidence levels.</li><li>Defensiveness.</li><li>Agreement.</li><li>Comprehension (or lack of understanding).</li><li>Level of interest.</li><li>Level of engagement with the message.</li><li>Truthfulness (or lying/dishonesty).</li></ul><div>As a speaker, understanding the secrets of your listener's body language can give you an opportunity to adjust your message and make it more understandable, appealing, or interesting. As a listener, body language can show you more about what the other person is saying. You can then ask questions to ensure that you have, indeed, understood each other. In both situations, you can better avoid miscommunication by paying attention to body language cues.<br><br></div><div>Feedback can also be formal. If you're communicating something really important, it can often be worth asking questions of the person you're talking to make sure that they've understood fully. And if you're receiving this sort of communication, take the time to repeat it in your own words to check your understanding.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>Summary&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div>It can take a lot of effort to communicate effectively. However, you need to be able to communicate well if you want to be on top of your game and make the most of the opportunities that life has to offer.<br><br></div><div>By learning the skills you need to communicate effectively, you can learn how to get your ideas across clearly and effectively, and understand much more of the information that's conveyed to you.<br><br></div><div>Whether you're a speaker, a listener, a writer, or a reader, you are responsible for making sure that messages are communicated accurately. Pay attention to words and actions, ask questions, and watch body language. These will all help to ensure that you say what you mean, and hear what is intended.<br><br></div><div>This site teaches you the skills you need for a happy and successful career; and this is just one of many tools and resources that you'll find here at talkwithecm. <br><br>Subscribe to our <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/subscribe.htm?tag=upsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>free newsletter</strong></a>, or <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/signup/monthly/usd?trackingtag=upsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>join the Mind Tools Club</strong></a> and really supercharge your career!<br><br></div><div></div>
