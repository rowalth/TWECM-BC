      <div>Jan 21 -<br>Hugging day&nbsp;</div><pre>Did you know that hugging triggers off the release of oxytocin, the “cuddle hormone” from the brain into your system, which in turn gives you that warm, fuzzy, loved, cuddly feeling. So folks, you know what to do. Go get you some hugs, go give someone a genuine, sincere, heartfelt hug and spread that warm fuzziness around for National Hugging Day.</pre><div><br>Feb 22<br>thinking day<br><br></div><pre>So, upon the first time I came across this day, I have to admit, I didn’t think much of it. Why do you need a day dedicated to thinking when there are procrastinators the world over doing this, and then overdoing it?! Then I thought to look into it a bit more. Turns out, this day is an opportunity to speak out on issues that affect young women and fundraise for 10 million Girl Guides and Girl Scouts in 150 countries. It has set themes for each year. Theme for 2022 is Stand Strong, Stand up and Stand Together for peacebuilding! A cause which speaks to my heart. So, how will you be celebrating this day? Are there any local initiatives that you know of? Share them here with us so we can all get involved.</pre><div><br><br>March 8<br>International woman's day<br><br></div><pre>The female of the species is more deadlier than the male, sang Space. In which case Mr Dudes everywhere, y’all best buckle up and help join the cause that is International Women’s Day, and don’t just stand alongside us for this one day or do it for lip service. Do it because you have mothers, sisters, daughters, a wife, girlfriend, nieces, grandmothers, aunts, do it for your female colleagues, do it for the future generations. After all, it was a woman who gave birth to you. So, we call upon you to stand by us and with us. This isn’t a war cry, nor was it a threat like the opening might have, maybe, kinda-sorta suggested. It’s a genuine, sincere ask. Support us in our campaigns to have an equal footing in education, work, politics, science, society, in life. Help make this world a safer place for all girls and all women everywhere.
There are many events taking place across the world in celebration of IWD. Tell me about at least one event happening where you are. Drop your links if any to that event (no requests for money, we’re watching). Let’s all back each other up. We’re all in this together, both women and men. Here’s to a future of equality and safety and plethora of opportunities for women and girls everywhere</pre>
