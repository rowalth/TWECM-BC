      <div><strong>IDEA 1: 3 things you can do to give a great first impression and get results from any networking event<br></strong>Prepare well before the event</div><ol><li>Do your research - Why are you there? What is your goal?&nbsp;<ol><li>and what to expect. What they don't publish is the reason why you are there - what is your goal? Is your primary goal getting a job, finding qualified customers or extending your network?&nbsp;</li><li>Who do you want to meet?&nbsp; Maybe you are in the market for a new job. Or perhaps you just moved to a new city and this wine tasting event looks like a good place to meet some like minded people. When going to a networking or social event, it is pretty easy to see who will be there. Most events publish this kind of information to attract visitors like you. Make a plan before you go</li><li>Taking some time to answer this question before you go helps you take control of the flood of input at large events and zero in on your results.</li></ol></li><li>Dress the part - How do you look?<ol><li>The whole idea of attending a networking event is to meet new people and extend your professional network. This means you'll be making a lot of first impressions – and we all know how important those can be. When you first meet someone new, there two things that you can control: How you look and what you say. We will talk about what you say next, but for now prepare yourself for success by dressing the part. It's no secret how important the way you look can be to making a favorable first impression, so be sure to choose an appropriate outfit. Most networking events are professional events, and you'd do well to dress the part. Even if the invite says "casual," better to err on the side of formal business attire. No one will fault you for looking too good.</li></ol></li><li>30 second pitch - Short &amp; Sweet<ol><li>A 30 second pitch, or elevator pitch, is a short statement giving all of the important information you want to share in an exciting way. If you work in sales, this could be a non-confrontational sales pitch, but generally it is more about helping your listener understand a larger concept easily in a very short amount of time. At a networking or social event people don't have time to sit and listen to a 3 hour lecture about your life, so don't do it.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Practice - Practice your 30 second pitch A LOT.<ol><li>Record yourself. Do you like how you look? Are you giving yourself a good first impression or are you bored watching your own 30 second video? Keep working and adjusting as you go until you feel comfortable with the way you look and sound.</li></ol></li></ol><div>Present your best at the event</div><ol><li>Be first - Don't make the beginner's mistake of arriving late.&nbsp;<ul><li>It may seem scary to be one of the first to arrive, especially if you feel nervous about the event. Yet, the truth is that arriving late means that you could spend a lot of valuable time wandering around trying to catch the crowd. Take my advice and arrive early. This means that you will be there calm and collected networking with other early arrivals before the event gets overwhelmingly crowded. <del>Jumping into a packed crowd is more for the advanced networkers, so make it easy on yourself. Also, remember, everyone is there to meet people too. So you can help them out by smiling and speaking first.</del></li></ul></li><li>Scan &amp; target - when first entering a group of people,&nbsp;</li><li>LISTEN - (copied) It can be easy to forget that a conversation should be a two-way street, especially if you've spent a lot of time and effort perfecting your personal introduction and your elevator pitch. The ultimate goal here is to find commonalities and make connections, which can be extremely difficult to do if you're not listening carefully.</li><li>be sincere - for real - even children can smell a fake,&nbsp; – set a goal to learn 5 things about the companies in attendance that you didn't know before the event.<br><br></li><li>Follow up, follow up, follow up - (copied) It is arguably the single most important part of going to a networking event, yet many job seekers still don't follow up with new contacts. By not reconnecting outside of the event itself, you're essentially undoing all the work you put into preparing for and attending the event in the first place. There is simply no excuse for not reaching out. Even if you've aren't looking for a job, solidifying a contact and building your professional network is always worth your effort.<br><br></li></ol><div><strong>IDEA 2: How to instantly make a better first impression</strong><br><br></div><ol><li>Prepare - these are perhaps things that you perhaps already know, yet it is important to regularly refresh - if you are bored with your look, others will be too.<ol><li>Do your research - know who you are meeting- what is your goal? having this in mind will help you put your best foot forward</li><li>Dress the part - (copied)&nbsp; It's no secret how integral your attire can be to making a favorable first impression, so be sure to choose an appropriate outfit. Make no mistake, a networking event is a professional event, and you'd do well to dress the part. Even if the invite says "casual," better to err on the side of business. Step it up a notch - wear an 'interesting' tie or piece of jewellery - potential conversational piece.&nbsp;</li><li>30 second pitch - crisp, clear &amp; to the point, mumbling and fishing for words is awkward for you and your listener! prepare before you dare</li></ol></li><li>Practice - practice your 30 second pitch A LOT before game day. Record yourself. Do you like how you look? Are you giving yourself a good first impression or are you bored watching your own 30 second video?<ol><li>be first -&nbsp; so help them out by being first 'Hi, my name is Elizabeth. What brings you here?' And be ready to follow up with your prepared &amp; practiced 30 second pitch, done well this can not only help you, but also others feel more comfortable - what a great first impression!</li><li>LISTEN - (copied) be sincere, for real, perhaps set a goal to learn 2 things about the person you are talking with - people generally love to talk about themselves &amp; love to feel heard. You can use this to your advantage. It can be easy to forget that a conversation should be a two-way street, especially if you've spent a lot of time and effort perfecting your personal introduction and your elevator pitch. The ultimate goal here is to find commonalities and make connections, which can be extremely difficult to do if you're not listening carefully.</li><li>Be gentle with yourself - example - don't judge yourself in the moment - go ahead make mistakes, meet lots of new people to practice &amp; improve these skills overtime. Judging yourself in the moment usually causes an unintentional weird or awkward face and this will make the person speaking with you awkward too!&nbsp;</li><li>no need to be overeager - example head nodding - 1 is great, shows you are listening, 2 is ok, 6 is terrible - is distracting and suggests that you are insecure, or even worse, not even listening<br><br></li></ol></li><li>Follow up, follow up, follow up - (copied) It is arguably the single most important part of going to a networking event, yet many job seekers still don't follow up with new contacts. By not reconnecting outside of the event itself, you're essentially undoing all the work you put into preparing for and attending the event in the first place. There is simply no excuse for not reaching out. Even if you've secured a position through different channels, solidifying a contact and building your professional network is always worthwhile.<br><br></li></ol><div><strong>IDEA 3: Fake it until you make it - 3 things you can do right now to instantly appear more confident</strong></div><ol><li>filler words&nbsp;<ol><li>silence vs. filler phrases</li><li>chunks &amp; pauses</li></ol></li><li>Experiments<ol><li>eye contact challenge - one second longer than usual, or ultimate challenge - keep smiling &amp; blinking until the other person looks away :) You won't appear to be a creep, unless you actually are a creep.&nbsp;</li><li>personal space exercises - for a moment get closer, get further, watch what happens! The best part about these experiments is that people tend to react instantly!&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>self-judgement - STOP IT! could potentially lead to a downward spiral, focus on staying fresh &amp; light at least in the moment, you should reflect back after the fact, of course! each mistake is a window to the next improvement :)<ol><li>judging self -make funny faces - micro expressions that can confuse or turn off your listener</li><li>judging you - now that we are talking about micro expressions, you might notice them more and more, especially when you are talking with another person, remember most of the time they are about themselves - not you!</li></ol></li></ol><div><br>IDEA #4 - How to win at networking<br><br></div><div>Look good</div><ul><li>Dress well - How you look is important for making a good first impression. Most networking events are professional events, and you'd do well to dress the part.</li><li>Be first - Don't wait for others to notice you. Start with something simple and be first. 'Hi, my name is Elizabeth. What brings you here?'&nbsp;</li><li>Make eye contact - Eye contact is the simplest way to connect with others, build trust and let them know that you are interested.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Speak well</div><ul><li>Take an active role - Be an active participant in the conversation so that you help the conversation flow in the direction that you want it to go.</li><li>Avoid controversial topics - While it is a great idea to talk about news, current events, and a variety of subjects, controversial things should be avoided. Making others uncomfortable is not a great way to make a first impression.</li><li>Know your goal - Why are you there? Who do you want to meet? Knowing your goal in advance helps keep you motivated and focused on making good connections.</li></ul><div>End well</div><ul><li>Make a clear close - Networking is often about meeting a lot of people in a short amount of time. When it is time to move on, express your thanks and make a clean exit.</li><li>Solidify your contacts - Don't want to get lost in the shuffle? Take the time to follow up. Even if you've aren't looking for a job, solidifying a contact and building your network is always worth your effort.&nbsp;</li></ul><div></div>

      <div>all 3 ideas are good and worth trying out. Let's start with the first = number 3. Maybe we can provide a worksheet with Idea 3. Something like a self assessment before and after the event.<br><br>The more I am jumping back and forth between the ideas, I like idea 1 more and more. I think it would be great to have a tool/trick/worksheet whatever, that delivers results and idea 1 seems to deliver results = more contacts.<br><br>I would offer a PDF / worksheet.&nbsp;<br><br>Let's discuss.</div>
