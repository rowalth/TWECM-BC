Success comes down to our ability to communicate in a way that’s clear, concise, and understood by everyone - not just those who think like us.<br>AND by understanding our own communication style and those of the people around us, we get invaluable clarity into how to speak so that we can be heard (and how to hear what everyone else is saying).&nbsp;<br>So, how to quickly assess others - without making them take this quiz, share link &lt;3&nbsp;<br>Quick test:</div><ol><li><strong>Ask Questions - </strong>What’s one thing that I could share with you today, that would make this a great use of your time?<br>(listen for communication type!)</li><li><strong>Observe Reactions</strong></li><li><strong>Listen Actively to get clues</strong></li></ol><ul><li>A <strong>Tiger</strong> will instantly give you a response, and typically won’t ask whether you agree.</li><li>A <strong>Horse</strong>, on the other hand, will say what he or she thinks, and then ask a genuine question: “That’s just my sense of it. What’s your opinion?”</li><li>A <strong>Dolphin</strong> who focuses on feelings will talk about the quality of the people he or she works with and their ability to meet whatever challenges lie ahead.</li><li>A <strong>Honey Bee</strong> will talk about studies or numbers or industry trends.</li><li>Then speak directly to THEIR style!</li></ul><div>1.

Tigers - confident<strong>: THE BIG-PICTURE THINKERS</strong><br><strong>(gut feelings/intuitive)</strong><br>Try to:</div><ul><li>Stick to the main topic and keep it high-level</li><li>Be prepared to answer follow-up questions</li><li>Keep details to a minimum (you can always follow up with these in an email after the conversation so they can reference back later on)</li></ul><div><br>Avoid:</div><ul><li>Too many details (obviously)</li><li>Taking their approach personally (they’re just doing what feels right to them)</li><li>protect yourself - committing to too big promises (they’ll latch onto the big picture and ignore the details of how hard it might be to pull off)</li></ul><div>3. <strong>horse</strong>s - <strong>FUNCTIONAL: DEALING WITH EVERYTHING ONE STEP AT A TIME - all about the PROCESS<br></strong><br>Try to:</div><ul><li>Practice “active listening” by repeating what they’ve said and asking follow-up questions</li><li>Expect them to ask for details, even if you’re just brainstorming</li></ul><div><br>Avoid:</div><ul><li>Rushing them to get to the end or make a decision</li><li>Assume they support an idea 100%, even if they say yes, you can expect some criticism or feedback on the steps / process&nbsp;</li></ul><div>4. Dolphins - <strong>PERSONAL/ RELATIONSHIPS OVER INFORMATION EXCHANGE<br>How are we all feeling about this?</strong><br>Try to:</div><ul><li>Keep conversations light and casual - meaningful small talk</li><li>don't take what they say as a personal attack - that is, Not get offended if they ask how something made you “feel” or if they somehow make something that you consider a strictly work conversation shift to personal stuff</li><li>treat them with respect &amp; Follow up with important details and information by email after the meeting (because their focus is probably elsewhere, they won’t focus on it too much on the details during your initial conversation)</li></ul><div><br>Avoid:</div><ul><li>Talking down to them or being overly pessimistic - that doesn't help any situation, regardless of their communication style, but for the people who are keenly aware of feelings - they pick up on “vibes” more than others</li><li>Try to contain the conversation to just stats and facts</li><li>Pressure them to do a deep dive into the details with you</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Thing 3.</strong> now you know your communication type &amp; even have some tools to start using in your next business meeting or even email communication - because the written word is communication too!&nbsp;<br>It is time for step 3 - the best part! - to really unlock your natural strengths and turn them into communication super powers it time to talk about - Magnetic Attraction!&nbsp;<br>because there is NO one size fits all solution, depending on the answer to this quiz there is a specific path for you to follow that exactly matches you &amp; your communication type.<br><br>click the link below to set up a free -zero obligation - consultation call with me.&nbsp;<br>Seriously - a 1:1 call - direct access to me so that we can dive into your results, unlock your communication super powers and discover the best path for you - this is based on your personal communication style so that you can harness the power of&nbsp;<br>Charisma / first impressions / mastering the art of body language - because yes, this matters even in digital meetings!
