Welcome You are in! <br><br></strong>Welcome to VFN Professionals! <br>Thanks for signing up.<br><span style="background-color: rgb(238, 226, 215);">As part of this group, we welcome you to share and grow with us. <br>All of our official communication (meet ups, workshops, etc.) is shared via email, so watch your inbox for news &amp; updates from VFN Professionals. </span><br>What are you struggling with today?<strong><br><br>1. Welcome to our tribe :)</strong></div><div>Hello !<br><br>Welcome to VFN Professionals!<br><br>Welcome to our growing group - I am glad that you are here. VFN Professionals is a solutions oriented group focused on questions around the topic <strong><em>"How can I be seen as a professional and have a family at the same time?"</em></strong>&nbsp;<br><br>Our activities are based on three core values:&nbsp;</div><ol><li>Connect</li><li>Reflect</li><li>Perfect</li></ol><div><br><span style="background-color: rgb(250, 247, 133);">These three words describe the active role members take and the opportunities available to you within our group.<br></span><br>This group makes it easy for you to connect with others who already understand the challenges you face as both a professional and an international family living here in Vienna. <strong><br></strong><br>Often when facing struggles, I feel alone, as if I'm the only person who has ever encountered this situation. As I open up and share with others, I have learned that like me, a lot of people feel isolated confused and don't even know where to find support. I used to think that if I was smarter or more experienced, I wouldn't have these problems. The truth is that I've seen even highly skilled professional people feel stuck and frustrated, desperately looking for solutions. I created this group so we can all join together, share information &amp; find support. Some people join this group because they want to save their career, others want to bring harmony to their family, for others the priority now is to resurrect their social life and for quite a number of people they want to tackle all of these areas (yikes!). <br><br>At VFN Professionals we understand what you are going through because many of us have been there and have already faced the same challenges. By discussing and walking through topics with us, you too can get unstuck and find real solutions. As a group we can share resources and support from experience and insider knowledge. <br><br><strong>You are not alone, you have found your tribe.<br><br></strong><span style="background-color: rgb(250, 247, 133);">Now that you know a bit more about our group, take a moment to think about others you know who could benefit as well. By inviting others to this group, you can help them connect and find solutions as well as enrich your own experience with the group. As one member wrote, "The more we share the good stuff, the more of it there is!"</span><br><br>Are you excited? We are. Because we believe everyone can benefit from sharing our collective knowledge and experience. Invite friends and colleagues to join you in the group with a message like this:<br><br>❝<em>I just joined VFN Professionals. This is a solutions oriented group focused on questions around the topic "How can I be seen as a professional and have a family at the same time?"

During my pregnancy and early months as a new mom, I have had great experiences with other members that truly enrich my life. I honestly can’t imagine being a parent without the support of this group! As my baby grew and many of the parents in my group started to go back to work, I noticed that a lot of us were struggling to find answers to our questions about: <strong>"How can I be seen as a professional and have a family at the same time?"</strong> Although many of us were asking the same question, I didn't hear any clear answers. It was exactly at that point that I had the idea to reach out and start a new group - the VFN Professionals. <br><br>My goal is to go beyond simply asking questions and start finding solutions through the support of our collective knowledge and experience. So far, your response has been amazing! Did you know that we are over 100 confirmed members? More importantly, I really appreciate the personal emails and messages that some of you have already sent to me. Thank you! <br><br>As I mentioned in the welcome email, you are not alone, you have found your tribe. I am excited to have this opportunity to volunteer my professional community building skills as a way to say thank you and give back to the VFN. <br><br><strong>What's your story? Why did you join VFN Professionals?</strong><br><br>Feel free to create a new post and share a little bit about who you are and why you want to connect with VFN Professionals.<br><br><strong>Not sure what to write?</strong></div><div><br>Consider answering the following questions:<br>1 - How do you expect to benefit from VFN Professionals?

What are the most important and immediate solutions that you need?&nbsp; These should be short term or pressing goals. We'll call this list your <strong>Quarter Targets</strong>. <br><br>Share your <strong>Quarter Targets</strong> in our facebook group or send it to me by email. Think of this as your first step towards finding a solution. <br><br>I'll go first - here are my Quarter Targets:<br>1. I want to create a child-safe play area in my home. (So I can focus on other things besides damage control.)<br>2. Identify the needs and pains of my target audience.

We both know that this email will simply get lost somewhere down at the bottom of your inbox. If you are honest with yourself, it should only take 2 minutes to know what the biggest topics are for you at the moment.&nbsp; So make a quick list, it doesn't have to be perfect, you can always update it or even change it later.<br><br>These lists are useful for building smaller networks within our group and will help guide our plans for upcoming meetings and workshops.</div><div><br>I can't wait to see your Quarter Targets!<br><br><strong>6.

VFN Professionals)<br><br>Hello &lt;first name&gt;,<br><br>How is it going? What is your progress?<br><br>Today I want to talk about our third core value - <strong>Perfect.</strong> <br>(Note: Here the word <em>perfect</em> is used as a verb meaning — you guessed it! — to make something better. Be aware of the pronunciation difference: PER-fect as a adjective; per-FECT as a verb. Can you tell I'm a Fluency Coach?) <br><br>Our third core value is about action steps. What are we doing to change our situation and move forward?<br><br>At this point, you have had the opportunity to check out our facebook group, connect with others and reflect on your situation. I even asked to you make a short list of the 2-3 topics that you want<strong> </strong>to focus on for this quarter (3 months). We called this your <strong>Quarter List</strong>.<br><br>Today, I encourage you to shift your thinking towards taking <strong>action</strong> and make a new step towards reaching your goals. Revisit your Quarter List and answer these questions:</div><ul><li>What is my progress?&nbsp;</li><li>What is still missing?&nbsp;</li><li>What action steps do I need to take?</li></ul><div><br>Be honest with yourself when answering these questions. If you feel stuck, reach out.

VFN Professionals)<br><br>Hello &lt;first name&gt;,<br><br>How is it going? What is your progress?<br><br>Today I would like to continue talking about our third value - <strong>PERFECT.</strong><br><br>Once you have determined how you wish to make changes and what outcomes you want, the next big hurdle is making it actually happen, right? <br><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 229, 229);">Tell me if you can relate to this: When trying to make changes, sometimes I feel like I am caught in a hamster wheel. At times I make a lot of noise and try a lot of different things, but nothing seems to work</span> out right. Other times I am distracted, or worse completely paralysed by indecision about which steps to actually take. In the end, the result seems to be the same; time goes by and I feel no closer to my goals than when I started. So frustrating! <br><br><strong>How can I get off the hamster wheel?</strong><br>One of the best solutions I have found to break out of the hamster wheel is reaching out to other people. This can mean reaching out to a friend or loved one. Usually, however, I find it is better to reach out to someone new, a person with new ideas and perspectives. Someone who can help shake things up a bit and help me get unstuck. Sometimes this means finding a mentor, an accountability partner or both! Networking and reaching out to others has helped me create valuable relationships and build up the support system I need while living abroad.&nbsp;<br><br>VFN Professionals is an extension of this idea. As a group we represent many different countries, cultures and industries, and we all chose to live and work here in Vienna with our families.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Today I encourage you to think about your support network. In general, you are the average of the five people that you surround yourself with. Are you getting the support and encouragement that you want? Or are you stuck in a hamster wheel?<br><br>Please take this short surveyAre you already working with a coach, mentor, accountability partner or mastermind group? Tell me about that -<br><br>How is this person or group pushing you forward?
