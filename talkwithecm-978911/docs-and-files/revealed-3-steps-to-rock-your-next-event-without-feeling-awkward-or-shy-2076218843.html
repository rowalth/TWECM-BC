      <div>"Ugg! I wish that I had talked to you about this last week!" my friend moaned. We were catching up at a local coffee shop and she was feeling really frustrated. She had the opportunity to represent her company to a high profile client, and not just any client, but her dream employer - the exact company where she would <em>love </em>to work.&nbsp;<br><br>"Awesome!" I cheered, but she didn't look happy about it at all.&nbsp;<br><br>"No, it was awful." She felt blocked. She wasn't sure how to show that she was interested in joining their team without seeming too opportunistic or disloyal to her current job. So, in the end, she said nothing at all!<br><br>"It's like I was given the golden opportunity - my dream job! - and I just threw it away...ugg! But now I know exactly what to do and focus on for our next meeting!"<br><br>Whether you are looking for a job, want to grow your business or are looking to push your career to the next level, you know that networking is vital for your career. But, like my friend, you may still be unclear or even hesitant about what it really means to network. Whether your event is tonight, next week or next month, use this quick guide to zero in on the essential elements of networking to get the results you want.&nbsp;<br><br>It seems that everyone knows that networking is important, but very few people actually know what is involved, what to do, or how to enjoy the process! When working with people to prepare for a networking event, I hear a lot of questions, like this:</div><ul><li>Who should I talk to?&nbsp;</li><li>What should I say?&nbsp;</li><li>I hate small talk!</li><li>Is it even worth it?</li></ul><div><strong>The truth is that networking is about personal connections and creating relationships, not just getting a job or closing a sale. </strong>And no matter how advanced technology may be, face to face communications and personal connections still carry more weight and open more doors than emails and texts. Plus, events can be a super efficient way to meet a large number of like minded people in a short amount of time.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>With just a bit of prework, you can come home from your next event with something much more valuable than a pile of random business cards and memories of cheese cubes.

If you’re not sure what to wear, check the website and promotional materials to get an idea of what’s appropriate.</li><li><strong>Rehearse.</strong> Practice introducing yourself, your 30 second pitch and some relevant small talk. You need to be prepared to speak and present yourself in a confident and interesting way. It also helps to have a few subjects in your pocket that you can discuss to create connections and build rapport.</li><li><strong>Volunteer &amp; get involved. </strong>Helping out at events can be a great way to reduce your expenses and become engaged even if you tend to feel shy. Contact the organizers to find out about volunteer opportunities.&nbsp;</li></ol><blockquote>Because I tend to be shy, I always try to volunteer for the sign-in desk.

Acting as a hub and providing introductions strengthens your network and helps others feel more comfortable as well. Being helpful and generous also makes it likely you’ll receive similar favors.

You’ll make a positive impression and their interest may still be high.</li><li><strong>Review &amp; reflect.</strong> Think of developing your networking skills as an ongoing project. After each event, reflect on what went well and what you can do differently next time.</li></ol><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Going to events and trying to network may seem like a lot of effort, but when you are warmed up and ready to go, the opportunities and potential for growth are absolutely worth it.

      <div>email to list:<br>Hello {$name},<br><br></div><div>Networking - that hot buzz word - it seems that everyone is talking about it, and how important it is, but what exactly does it mean?&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>When working with people to prepare for a networking event, I hear a lot of questions, like this:<br><br></div><ul><li>Who should I talk to?&nbsp;</li><li>What should I say?&nbsp;</li><li>I hate small talk!</li><li>Is it even worth it?</li></ul><div>Out of curiosity, I decided to dig deeper, and ask around to see what people really think about when they hear the word <em>networking</em>. I've found that the answers people give fall into two very different categories:<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;<strong><em>&nbsp;'It's kinda fun' Group<br></em></strong><br></div><ul><li><em>Networking? I go, eat food, meet people...collect business cards...it is kinda fun.</em></li><li><em>They usually have good food.</em></li><li><em>I hate networking events, it's just a bunch of scammy sales people or CV pushers desperately looking for work. A total waste of time!</em></li></ul><div>Those are some of the answers I've gotten - seriously. Which is pretty crazy! Especially when I consider how much time and money goes into creating these networking events - and the best response is, "it's kinda fun."&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>And the second group, <br>'<strong>It's AMAZING!' Group</strong></div><ul><li>If you're in my industry, you'll be at that event. That's where all of the top players meet.&nbsp;</li><li>It's AMAZING what a great network can make possible!</li><li>It's been the backbone of my career &amp; development.</li></ul><div>I know, it is difficult to believe, but both groups were asked the exact same question about networking, and yet their answers are dramatically different. Can you spot the one thing that makes all of the people in the first group different than the people in the second group?<br><br>HINT: It's not their industry, level of education, age, gender or anything that people can usually check off in a survey.&nbsp;<br><br>What do you think? Send me an email and let me know. I'd love to hear your ideas.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll send you another email in the next days with my insights, but while you are waiting, check out this article I posted about how to Rock Your Next Event.<br><br><br></div><div></div>
