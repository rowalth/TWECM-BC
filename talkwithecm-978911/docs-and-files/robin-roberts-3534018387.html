Why me?&nbsp;<br>Why this?<br>Why is there here in my story, what am I supposed to learn?<br><br>We're going to talk about that, but that's not what this class is all about. It's about communicating. It's about working on your communication skills.<br>[00:02:00.96] Well, what is authentic and effective communication? This right now. I know I can't see you, but you can see me. I'm looking at you. I'm looking at you in your eyes. When's the last time that someone has done that? How many times have people passed by you on the street or you're at work or something and they morning and they're not even looking at you? They're not even-- don't even give you good morning. They say, morning, not even looking at you.<br>[00:02:30.09] So I'm going to show you and share with you why that is important, how to do that, why you should do that, the benefits of doing that. Why should you communicate clearly, effectively? If-- if you know how you can get through this life without doing that, would you let me know?<br>[00:02:52.37] Because I don't know how you can do that. I don't know why you would want to do that. I can't think of-- I cannot think of any line of work, anything that you're doing that you are not going to benefit greatly by being able to communicate effectively. That is my hope with the class, in showing you how you can do that.<br>[00:03:20.79] In this class, I'm going to talk to you about negotiating, about effective ...public speaking, body language, back straight, eye contact...connecting, being a better communicator&nbsp;<br><br>- BIG SECRET --&gt; LISTEN<br><br>take a genuine interest in someone,&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
