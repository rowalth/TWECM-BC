BUT I do have an answer: good men are everywhere you are!<br><br></div><div>Seriously.<br><br></div><div>Think about all the errands you run (grocery store, coffee shop, laundromat), your commute to work (bus, train, walking, parking garage, taking the elevator), grabbing food on your lunchbreak at the deli, meeting your aunt for dinner, bringing your dog to the dog park, running a 5K, taking a cooking class….<br><br></div><div>_<br>The good, single men you want to connect with are doing these EXACT SAME THINGS!<br><br></div><div>And honestly, it’s SO much better to meet someone as you’re simply doing stuff like this and being your natural self as opposed to trying to “save up” all your best outfits, flirting moves, and <a href="https://sexyconfidence.com/how-to-make-a-man-miss-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>techniques to attract a guy only when hitting up bars on the weekend.<br></strong></a><br></div><div>A few examples of “unconventional” places I’ve been asked out by men, just to get the ball rolling on some of the possibilities:<br><br></div><div>•&nbsp; Airplane<br>•&nbsp; Airport bar<br>•&nbsp; Grocery store<br>•&nbsp; Volunteering at an animal shelter<br>•&nbsp; Set of a TV show<br>•&nbsp; Walking down the street<br>•&nbsp; Greeting card aisle of the drug store<br>•&nbsp; Charity event<br>•&nbsp; Starbucks<br>•&nbsp; Work<br>•&nbsp; Bus stop<br>•&nbsp; My high school reunion<br>•&nbsp; My apartment building lobby<br>•&nbsp; Visiting friends out of town<br>•&nbsp; BBQs, picnics, weddings, concerts, birthday parties, any type of gatherings!<br><br></div><div>Think of some places you frequent – I’m willing to bet there’s an opportunity to meet a guy at most of them.<br><br></div><div>OK, so single men are everywhere. Now, how do you spot them?<br><br></div><div>Simple. You don’t.<br><br></div><div>You let them spot YOU.<br><br></div><div>Whether they’re aware of it or not, single men (and, unfortunately, ones who aren’t happy in their current relationship) have a high tendency to constantly be looking around. It’s just in their nature.<br><br></div><div>I’ll watch a woman walk into a new space (lobby, room, bus, wherever) and within seconds be able to tell which men are single based on how they react.<br><br></div><div>The single ones will not only be looking around, they’ll actually stare much longer – while the (happily) committed guys, even if they looked up to see who this new human in their presence is, will almost immediately go back to whatever they were doing.<br><br></div><div>It’s really funny to watch, especially since they don’t know that they’re actually the ones being watched and it’s such a universal pattern.<br><br></div><div>And because most women aren’t paying attention when they walk into a new place, they totally miss it.<br><br></div><div>So when the guy who was instantly attracted to you as soon as you came into the room actually approaches you, you’re totally caught off-guard because you never even saw him coming.<br><br></div><div>My motto? “Be prepared, not scared”.<br><br></div><div>Every time you walk into a new setting, take two seconds to look around you and see which men make eye contact with you.<br><br></div><div>Not only will you be able to spot them, but it’ll make it 10 times easier for you two to interact from that moment forward, knowing that you’re both aware of each other.<br><br></div><div>Now that you have some ways to warm-up your social muscle, know where to find quality men and how to spot them, read on to learn how to attract them to you like a magnet…<br><br></div><div><a href="https://www.masterofflinedating.com/dating-app-detox/#toc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Return to Table of Contents<br></em></strong></a><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>_<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>Step 1: How to Attract the Right Guy Like a Magnet (without saying a word)<br></strong><br></div><blockquote><br><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://www.masterofflinedating.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1(pp_w480_h719).png" width="450" height="676"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

Because it’s extremely powerful and will enable a conversation to continue for hours if you want it to.<br><br></div><div>Yep, hours. Even in the middle of an airport. But that’s a story for another time.<br><br></div><div>Anyway, back to inserting yourself in someone’s story. Imagine yourself as them, and ask questions where you need more information.<br><br></div><div>For example, say the other person starts off with I was at lunch today and overheard the weirdest conversation.<br><br></div><div>Now, picture yourself at lunch, like they were.<br><br></div><div>Wait a second, where are you at lunch?<br><br></div><div>What restaurant, what’s the atmosphere like?<br><br></div><div>Who are you with?<br><br></div><div>You need to know these in order to get an accurate picture of where “you” (and the storyteller) are so you can stay with them throughout the rest of the story.<br><br></div><div>So, ask them those questions!<br><br></div><div>Ohhhh I love weird conversations! OK first, where were you at lunch? Were you there with a coworker or a friend?<br><br></div><div>Get the full picture before they move on so you’re staying with them step-by-step through the story and questions are naturally popping up.<br><br></div><div>Eventually you’ll have all the logistical answers you need to know to have a clear picture of where you are, what you’re doing, and with whom.<br><br></div><div>And then, you can start asking more open-ended, hypothetical, or emotion-based questions.<br><br></div><div>Like if that overheard weird conversation was about someone who proposed to their girlfriend on a unicycle, you can ask the storyteller Is that something you’d ever consider doing for your girlfriend?<br><br></div><div>Or I actually think that’s kinda cool – if you were going to propose, how would you do it?<br><br></div><div>Or maybe the overheard convo was about a woman who just found out she’s officially cancer-free and is determined to live out her dream of living in a castle in Ireland.<br><br></div><div>You can ask the storyteller something like If you found out you only had a month to live, how would you feel – and what would you do with that month?<br><br></div><div>If you’re not used to asking detailed questions like this, it can seem intrusive.<br><br></div><div>But when asked with natural curiosity and the intention of learning more about the other person and their story, it will come across that way and show them a level of attention and warmth that few people in this world have the skill to do.<br><br></div><div>But if your intention is to be nosy or judgmental, that will come across.<br><br></div><div>Instead, simply listen, understand, and appreciate that another person is sharing a part of their life, I don’t care how small, with you in this moment.<br><br></div><div>I use this “empathetic listening” technique not just in coaching my clients, but with almost everyone I talk to.<br><br></div><div>It’s fun and is almost like giving the other person a gift – true acknowledgement and understanding.<br><br></div><div>Because honestly, how often do we really get that from other people?<br><br></div><div>When he feels your genuine interest in him, he’s much more likely to ask you out.<br><br></div><div>But wait, there’s more!<br><br></div><div>Want to add a dash of charisma to that genuine connection you just formed?<br><br></div><div>My friend (and women’s leadership coach) <a href="http://felicia-spahr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Felicia Spahr</strong></a> wrote a fantastic article for Business Insider giving you <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/use-charisma-to-be-a-better-leader-in-your-everyday-life-2016-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>6 ways to use charisma to be a stronger leader in your everyday life</strong></a>.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://www.masterofflinedating.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Felicia-Spahr-1(pp_w768_h512).jpg" width="423" height="282"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

But only if you promise not to kick yourself too hard for it.<br><br></div><div>Deal?<br><br></div><div>Here goes: he probably did ask you out – and you missed it.<br><br></div><div>I see this with my private clients a lot when we do “wingwoman” sessions and hit the town together to practice their skills with meeting men.<br><br></div><div>The crazy high fear of rejection everyone is worried about applies to both genders. So think about that from his perspective: he’s talking to this nice woman (you), she seems interested, but he’s not sure, so he’s going to play it somewhat safe and hope she gets the hint.<br><br></div><div>Something like <em>So when are we hanging out?<br></em><br></div><div>Or <em>Do you like [specific restaurant / music type / destination]?<br></em><br></div><div>Or responding to your questions of <em>What are you up to this weekend?</em> With <em>Hanging out with you!<br></em><br></div><div>These are some subtle (or not so subtle) examples of what guys have said to my clients that, unfortunately, went right over their heads as they blushed and smiled and immediately asked another question because they weren’t sure what else to do.<br><br></div><div>If he says anything that infers getting together or introduces a specific destination of some type and asks how you feel about it (type of ethnic cuisine, hobby, neighborhood, anything), jump on it!<br><br></div><div>This doesn’t mean you have to take the lead, but let him know that whatever he said is something you would gladly do with him by responding with something subtle.<br><br></div><div>Or maybe not so subtle – like <em>I’ve never been there but I’d love to go!<br></em><br></div><div>Or <em>Oh, we’re hanging out this weekend huh? What cool things are we doing together?</em> with a big smile.<br><br></div><div>Dating is a two-way street – a team sport. And when you team up together as partners, you both win.<br><br></div><div>So whenever possible, help a brother (or a sister) out by keeping your eyes open for the subtle ask-out and giving it some genuinely enthusiastic encouragement so you can both go home happy – and with a hot date!<br><br></div><div><a href="https://www.masterofflinedating.com/dating-app-detox/#toc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Return to Table of Contents<br></em></strong></a><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>_<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>What to do if you DON’T want him to ask you out<br></strong><br></div><div>_<br>Hey, it happens.<br><br></div><div>The guy in line behind you at the movie ticket counter seemed cool at first when he complimented your bracelet.<br><br></div><div>But a few minutes into the conversation you realize he’s clearly still hung up on his ex (being that he’s mentioned her twice already to a girl he just met).<br><br></div><div>If you’re getting the weird (not in a good way), creepy, aggressive, or player vibe – or something just seems off – below are a few ways to get out of the conversation.<br><br></div><div>But remember, only shut him down if there’s a legit reason – i.e. not because you’re nervous!<br><br></div><div>If he keeps talking to you and you want him to stop:<br><br></div><div><em>I’ve had a horrible day and I just need to be alone right now<br></em><br></div><div><em>My boyfriend loves that [sports team/state/beer type/whatever]!<br></em><br></div><div>If you can bolt quickly (e.g. no tab to pay off):<br><br></div><div><em>Well it was nice chatting with you, I’ve got to run!<br></em><br></div><div><em>Good luck with that big meeting tomorrow – see ya later!<br></em><br></div><div>If he asked you out:<br><br></div><div><em>Thank you, I’m flattered but I have a boyfriend.<br></em><br></div><div>If he persists after you’ve made it clear you’re not interested:<br><br></div><div><em>Sorry, I have to get home to my five cats and dress them up Lady Gaga-style!&nbsp;<br></em><br></div><div><em>I’m going to move seats if you don’t stop bothering me.<br></em><br></div><div>No matter what approach you choose, just make sure to lead with kindness.<br><br></div><div>As international dating guru Matthew Hussey put it “men are watching you to see how you treat others – you’re on show for the rest of the room”, and the guy who you want to approach you is watching how you reject other men.<br><br></div><div>I love the mentality he says to adopt of thinking “if a guy I liked was watching me, how would I want him to see me behaving?” (the answer is: classy and kind).<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><em>Click the video above to watch Matthew give the guy’s perspective on how to let him down easy<br></em><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Also, if you’re doing all the talking, close up shop and end the convo.<br><br></div><div>He could already be in a relationship, just got fired, his dog died yesterday.
