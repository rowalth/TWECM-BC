      <div>COVID-19 update:<br><br>The current pandemic has made an impact on everyone, all over the world. Some of us have already lost loved ones, some have lost jobs or businesses, some feel abandoned, and some of us are way to overwhelmed to handle it all. In a very short amount of time our world has been turned upside down and although I don't have all the answers, nobody does, I want to offer some insights that I've gotten from a lot of conversations that I've had in the past few weeks. They might help you get through this time, because the truth is that we are all in this together. <br><br>But first, let's talk about where you are. Tell me, what is your current biggest struggle or barrier at the moment?<br><br>Loss - loss loved ones, of job, income, security. Maybe your plans have been thrown in the trash. If you were planning a wedding, a birthday party, big vacation, I'm looking at you too. <br><br>Overwhelm - Working from home, children are home, climbing the walls, cabin fever, media overload, drowning in tasks, can't keep up with everything that you need to do. If you are working in the medical field, supermarkets, delivery services, I'm looking at you too.<br><br>Lack of focus - Loneliness, boredom, Netflix exhaustion, tired of watching the paint dry, sure you could take on a new project or new hobby, but getting up out of bed feels like the biggest task you can manage right now.&nbsp; <br><br>Out of balance - Stressed, easily agitated, getting lost in online arguments, fighting with your family about staying home.&nbsp; <br><br>Frustration about the future - feeling lost or helpless about getting back into the game. Or perhaps everything is ok right now, you might even be enjoying the break of having everyone stay home...but you know that your business, your source of income can not go on like this. If you are fine because you're living off of your savings, I'm looking at you. <br><br>Disconnected - all of this talk about Social distancing has left a lot of people feeling alone, abandoned and utterly isolated. Even if you are living a house with others, these feelings can still ring true. <br><br>Everything has shifted and changed so quickly and many of us are still trying to figure out the best ways to adjust. The most important message I can tell you is that you are NOT alone, we are all in this together. <br><br>When you have a moment, fill out my easy-peasy 20 second survey - really, it's that short &amp; let me know how you're doing. Or you can simply hit reply and send me an email. Let me know, I'd love to hear from you.<br><br>Staying physically distant and <em>socially </em>connected,<br>ecm<br><br>PS- Have you seen my newest facebook LIVE sessions?&nbsp;</div>
