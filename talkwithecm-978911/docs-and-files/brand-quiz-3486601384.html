      <h1>Introducing The Complete Brand Makeover Package</h1><div><br></div><div><em>June 17, 2019</em></div><div>As a small business owner, you work hard every single day to make your business dreams a reality. You juggle sales, marketing, employee retention, service quality, customer service, research and development...the list goes on.<br><br></div><div><br>It isn’t a 40-hour/week job... It’s a round-the-clock job.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>But as hard as you work to grow your business, you know it has to be built on solid ground: a brand that’s true to you, targeted to your ideal clients, and totally clear on the value you provide.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>So, is your brand working as hard as you are? It should be.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Not sure what we mean? Here are some questions to ask yourself.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>IS YOUR BRAND MEMORABLE?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><br>When creating your website, did you use a stock template in a rush to get “something” up fast? Does your logo look eerily similar to all of your competitors?<br><br></div><div><strong><br>DOES YOUR BRAND COMMUNICATE YOUR ‘WHY?’&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><br>When a potential client interacts with your brand for the first time, can they immediately understand why you do what you do? Do they know why your service is the best solution to their problems?&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong><br>DOES THE QUALITY OF YOUR BRANDING SPEAK TO THE QUALITY OF YOUR SERVICE?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Do your business’ words, visuals, and website communicate just how hard you will work for your clients? Or does your average appearance say you’ll do just an average job?<br><br></div><div><strong><br>IS YOUR BRANDING CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL MARKETING COLLATERAL AND ON ALL PLATFORMS?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Is your brand building trust with potential clients by showing up consistently, or are they confused as it varies from day to day depending on who’s creating the post and what they think looks or sounds best?&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Answered “no” to a few (or maybe all) of these? You’re not alone.<br><br></div><div><br>We’ve seen these struggles from businesses across all kinds of industries time and time again. Brand-building usually comes second to booking clients in the early days ...&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Until the quality of your brand starts getting in the way of your growth.<br><br></div><div><br>That’s why we’ve created <strong>The Complete Brand Makeover Package<br></strong><br></div><div><br>At the end of our time together, expect your brand to go from:<br><br></div><div><strong><br>CONFUSED ———&gt; CLARIFIED<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>RANDOM ———&gt; CONSISTENT<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>AVERAGE ———&gt; EXTRAORDINARY<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>CONVENTIONAL ———&gt; ONE-OF-A-KIND<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>STAGNANT ———&gt; DYNAMIC<br></strong></div>
