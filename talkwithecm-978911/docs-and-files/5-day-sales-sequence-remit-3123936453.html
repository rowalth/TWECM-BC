      <div><br><br><strong>day 1: Time management: are you really as busy as you </strong><strong><em>say </em></strong><strong>you are?<br></strong>Hi <strong>name</strong>Several weeks ago, I emailed you about burnout and time/energy management. It was one of the most popular emails I’ve ever sent (I received thousands and thousands of responses directly to my inbox).Not surprisingly, one of the most popular IWT posts is about time management.It seems we all love to talk about time management: How busy we are... how little we sleep... how we wish we could find the perfect “system” to optimize our time.But are you really as busy as you think?<br>I love this article from the Wall Street Journal:“There was a time, not so long ago, when I was busy, busy, busy. At least I thought I was.I told people I worked 60 hours a week. I claimed to sleep six hours a night. As I lamented to anyone stuck next to me at parties, I was basically too busy to breathe. Me time? Ha!My secret? I started keeping track of how I spent my time, logging how many hours and minutes I devoted to different activities such as work, sleep and chores.I soon realized I’d been lying to myself about where the time was going. What<br>I thought was a 60-hour workweek wasn’t even close. I would have guessed I spent hours doing dishes when in fact I spent minutes. I spent long stretches of time lost on the Internet or puttering around the house, unsure exactly what I was doing.”It’s almost like a slap in the face. All that time we’ve been complaining about how busy we are... but then when we wonder how other people get so much more done in the same 168 hours/week... we have no answer.<br><br>Let me offer 3 suggestions:<br>▶&nbsp; <strong>The mosT producTIve people I knoW spend more TIme ThInkIng abouT WhaT To Work on... Than hoW To be eFFIcIenT<br></strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>loW-producTIvITY people do exacTlY The opposITe, obsessIng abouT TacTIcs and soFTWare InsTead oF sYsTemaTIcallY decIdIng WhaT Is WorTh TheIr TIme<br></strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>In oTher Words, You can be hIghlY eFFIcIenT, buT IF You’re WorkIng on The Wrong ThIngs, IT doesn’T maTTer. ThInk abouT ThaT careFullY <br><br>— WhIch one are You?<br></strong>So... how do you actually turn those 3 suggestions into productivity for your life?I’ve put together some of my best time management material for you. But before I send you more, I want to hear more from you about how you’ve used (or not used) time management.Will you do me a favor and take 5 minutes to complete this time management survey?Link to surveyCheck your inbox tomorrow for more productivity insights. -RamitP.S. If enough people fill out the time management survey, I’ll share the results with everyone later this week. Here’s the link again: Link to survey<br><br><br><br><strong>daY 2: Why are you so lazy?<br></strong>Hi <strong>name<br></strong>Perhaps our generation’s greatest failing is how lazy we are.How many of my readers have sent me emails talking about how they want to change... how they want to improve their finances, or earn more, or manage their time better... or even <strong>read </strong>my book (which is sitting under their bed)...but they simply can’t find the motivation to do so?Thousands and thousands every year.Interestingly, we <strong>genuInelY </strong>want to change our behavior. We simply cannot figure out how to do it. We use words like “motivation” (one of the worst words to use in behavioral change since it means almost nothing). We say the “S” word: “Yeah, I really should do that...” We keep reading thinking that pretty soon will finally find that one magical nugget of info that changes our lives.We do all kinds of things that seem intuitive, but are worthless at best, and counter- productive at worst.If you’re serious about changing your own behavior, you need to know this:<br>▶&nbsp; <strong>Whenever You saY “should” — “Yeah, I reallY should do x” or “TheY should jusT do Y” — You have alreadY losT<br></strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>guIlT Is noT a producTIve emoTIon<br></strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>QuIck WIns produce massIve momenTum For behavIoral change. (hInT: ThIs Is WhY FInancIal books ThaT begIn WITh “creaTe a budgeT” are almosT never eFFecTIve. ThIs Is a massIvelY ImporTanT and FreQuenTlY mIssed poInT.)<br></strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>auTomaTIon Is more poWerFul Than almosT anYone can ImagIne<br></strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>sImplY “TrYIng harder” WIll almosT never Work, YeT mosT amerIcansFolloW ThIs polIcY repeaTedlY For TheIr enTIre lIves<br></strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>TacTIcs are noT enough. mosT oF us have crIpplIng barrIers and InvIsIble scrIpTs ThaT “screen” ouT even The mosT sophIsTIcaTed TacTIcs. (For example, I could gIve You The besT TIps on earnIng more ever creaTed, buT IF You don’T belIeve You deserve moneY, noThIng maTTers — You WIll noT even process The TIps.)<br><br></strong>And also, more information is probably not the answer. This is why I make my courses into step-by-step systems and not just content-dump ebooks.HOW you process the information and apply it to your life is just as important as what info you consume. Consider this excerpt from my interview with Stanford psychologist BJ Fogg:<strong>ramIT seThI:</strong>Information alone is not the most effective persuasive mechanism, and this is like... this flies in the face of everything that we hear in the media and in America, which is: let’s just give them more information, or let’s educate them. If we educated them they would come over to my side, but that’s not really true.<strong>bj Fogg:</strong>And you hear that all the time, and you hear it from academics who should know better, and I’m getting kind of grumpy about this... Oh, I’m getting a<br>little bit grumpier these days about it, because so much is at stake, and I<br>was at a, like I just said, I was at TED-Med not too long ago and it was a lot<br>of health professionals, and I had discussions with some of them who were creating interventions and they were relying largely on information and in one conversation I said: wait a minute you know that information about smoking or weight loss is not going to... and they’re like: yeah, we know but we don’t know what else to do. And I mean, that wasn’t the exact wording, but essentially that’s what they said, so even the pros still think, somehow, that information will magically transform behavioral change.<strong>ramIT seThI:</strong>Why do we think that?<strong>bj Fogg:</strong><em>[Laughs] </em>Ah, wow! Probably because we like to think we are rational, and we like to think, you know, kind of going back to: humans were noble, we are thoughtful, we are different than other animals, we can... So here is the chain you have to... information will then lead to attitude change and attitude change will then lead to behavior change.<strong>ramIT seThI:</strong>Oh!<strong>bj Fogg:</strong>And that’s the model, but there are two huge links, there and neither of them really works very well. So whenever you hear that, either information will then change attitudes, question that. Attitudes will then lead to... you know, changed attitudes will then lead to change... question that, that’s not really a reliable way to change behaviors.<strong>ramIT seThI:</strong>You know, what so interesting is that, I think we went maybe 9, 12 months at a certain point without collaborating or keeping up with each other’s works, and then we met again and it seems like we had actually, independently, come up to the same conclusions of focusing on behavior rather than attitude.<strong>bj Fogg:</strong>Yes, yes.<strong>ramIT seThI:</strong>For me, I was influenced by a lot of the behavior-attitude relationship studies, like there’s a great study where they had people looking at some kind of a TV show and in one condition they had them put something in their mouth and produced a frown, like with a pencil. And then in another condition they had them hold their pencil between their teeth and it made them smile, it made them activate their facial smiling muscles, and the people who smiled actually found that TV show funnier, and it was a great example of behavior-causing attitude change. So for me, in personal finance the reason that the first chapter of my book is not about like, let’s create a theory about money, or let’s talk about it, it’s like: here is how you negotiate with your credit cards it’s very much behavior.<br><strong>bj Fogg:</strong>Yeah.<strong>ramIT seThI:</strong>Because once people get that first win, then the attitude miles start to shift, but you have to get that behavior to change first.Think about this▶&nbsp; <strong>You don’T need To subscrIbe To 42 TIme managemenT blogs. You jusT need a FeW proven sTraTegIes and TacTIcs You can ImplemenT rIghT noW.</strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>You don’T need more InFormaTIon. InFormaTIon alone rarelY changes behavIor. You need a sYsTem To help You ImplemenT The TacTIcs.</strong>More on this tomorrow, but for anyone thinking they’ve already maxed out their productivity, check out the special time management report I’ve attached to this email.In it, my good friend Cal Newport, author of the popular blog Study Hacks, explains how he — an MIT postdoc — writes 3 books, a PhD defense, and 6+ peer-reviewed papers — and finishes by 5:30pm.This is the power of proven system for time management. -Ramit<br><br><strong>daY 3: What would you do with 1 extra hour per day?<br></strong>Hi <strong>name<br></strong>You’ll almost never hear someone in business say this:Most of my material is not appropriate for everyone.I really internalized this years ago when I stood outside a busy sushi restaurant in San Francisco. They had a line out the door <strong>everY nIghT</strong>, yet they could have easily fit in more tables to accommodate more guests and increase profit 25%.They didn’t allow substitutions. If your reservations weren’t made by 7pm, you were out of luck that night. Yet their sushi was so good, people lined up every night.What I learned was these owners are not merely motivated by money. They want to run their business the way they want to. And because the owners built a relationship with their customers, they came back night after night... while the people who weren’t right for the restaurant simply left.I loved the idea of finding the best students for life, and sending other people to sites more appropriate for them. That’s why I don’t talk about frugality very much — because there are better sites out there for you. That’s why I don’t charge $8 for my material — because if you aren’t prepared to invest in yourself, my site isn’t right for you.In fact, I give away 98% of my material for free, but when I charge, I charge extraordinarily premium prices.Yet...I actively take pains to discourage people from joining my premium material. If they have credit card debt, I don’t allow them to join my flagship courses. If I found out they disobeyed me and joined anyway, I ban them from ever purchasing anything from me ever again — for life.This costs me hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, but it’s the right thing to do.Sometimes they can’t afford it. Sometimes they’re not psychologically ready. Sometimes they’re not at the place in life where it will make the most difference.Why? Who in their right mind would openly say that his material isn’t right for everyone, and turn down hundreds of thousands of dollars a year?“Students for life” — I’ve mentioned before that this is my goal. That’s why I give away most of my material for free. And that’s why I always aim to make my free material better than most people’s paid material. If you’ve seen any of my material — my emails, Earn1K, Dream Job, even my book — you know that by the time you ever see my material “in the wild,” it’s been thoroughly tested and built on proven systems and behavioral psychology— so it actually delivers results.See, my goal isn’t to get the largest number of one-time customers. If I wanted to do that, I could release some cheap $18 ebook, sell 25,000 copies, and make a bunch of money. But where’s the value in that? I don’t want one-time customers. I want to cause true behavioral change for my students for life. My students get such ridiculous amount of value from my material that they keep coming back. Again, most of my premium material isn’t right for everyone — or even most people.<strong>WhaT IF You could save 1 hour per daY?</strong>How many of us are looking for ways to improve our time management... too be more productive... to never wonder <strong>WhaT </strong>to do, but to wake up and be in the zone?What if you could do this?“Your productivity tips help me work full-time, run 70+ miles a week and race competitively, be a boyfriend, work on a side business, and I’m now working on a second project. I also read ~1 book per week, go out with my friends, and take naps. I’m killing it. The only negative thing I can say is that my girlfriend<br>is annoyed when she hears your voice at 6:30AM talking about <strong>geT In Your cusTomer’sheads! </strong>She’salsoreadyourbook,openedaRothIRA,started negotiated, tutors on the side thanks to ads based on your marketing tips ($75 an hour!), and reads your blog. We’re “get after life” nerds.” -Jason Fitzgerald<br>We look at “time masters” — those people who have the same hours every day that we have, but seem to get 10x more done — and wonder how they did it. On those few days where we’re productive, we feel superhuman... but those days are few and far between. How do top performers do it, day after day?In other words, what could you accomplish with an extra hour of time every day?<strong>announcing the “I Will Teach You To be rich” productivity pack</strong>Time management is so critical that I build it directly into all of my flagship courses. And for the first time, I’m offering a selection of that material to people who haven’t purchased my $1,000+ courses — so you can use the same sophisticated time- management strategies that my top students have access to.You’ll learn how to combine time-management theory with tested systems so you can “weave” these principles into your daily life. No more depending on willpower — you’ll usethe power of automation to “force” yourself to work on the right things.<br>▶&nbsp; <strong>even IF You have mulTIple InTeresTs.<br></strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>even IF You geT dIsTracTed easIlY.<br></strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>even IF You’ve Wondered hoW To Wake up everY mornIng WITh more energY... buT You’re noT a “mornIng person.”<br></strong>I’ve never made this Productivity Pack — Powerful Automation, Systems, and Productivity — available publicly, but this is a limited test, open for only 48 hours. After that, I’m taking this page down. So if you could benefit from saving 1 hour per day for the rest of your life, then I hope you’ll take action.And of course, if this Productivity Pack doesn’t save you at least 1 hour per <strong>daY</strong>, just email me for a 100% refund. From testing this material with thousands of other students, I’m confident it will give you a massively Big Win.Link-RamitP.S. What would you do with an extra hour per day? Work out? Learn that language? Hang with your friends or start a side business?P.P.S. I estimate that 50% of people reading this email will say, “Yeah... I should really do that” or “I’ll look at this later”... and then take no action. Will you?<br><br><br><strong>daY 4: Your questions answered — Time management Q&amp;a<br><br></strong>Hey <strong>name<br></strong>I got a bunch of questions about this new mini-course on saving one hour/day, so I wantedto answer them here before I close the course tonight.The course is called the IWT Productivity Pack: Powerful Automation, Systems, and Productivity and includes videos on integrating systems and psychological time-saving techniques into your life. I interview two people I call on for help — Tim Ferriss and Laura Roeder — who have helped me become insanely productive.“While Ferriss writes books with some sensational titles, he is a master at time allocation and has some*very* useful things to say about saving oneself from‘overwhelm.” -Maria WebsterBy the way, yes — this course is only open for 48 hours. You know why? Because people who take days and weeks to deliberate on investing in themselves miss out on opportunity after opportunity (meaning no course would ever help them), while people who are hungry to invest in themselves make rapid decisions and continue moving forward. Momentum is important.<strong>Q: “can I Take ThIs aT mY oWn pace or do I have To FolloW a schedule?”</strong>A: This class is a “take-at-your-own-pace” class, where we’ll send you the videos and materials to use at your convenience. And you’ll have lifetime access to review them anytime you want. If you have a trip/wedding/etc planned, you can “pause” the material and re-watch at any time,<strong>Q: “hoW much maTerIal Is In ThIs course?”</strong>A: There are videos, PDFs, and several pieces of material that will change the way you think about how you currently manage time — you can see all the details here — but I’m going to challenge you on this question because I believe it’s the wrong question to ask. If you’re judging something by the amount of material in it, you’ve already lost. That’s like asking a teacher how many pages she’ll assign you that year — it has nothing to do with how much you’ll learn, retain, and be able to apply. If you find only one time-saving technique, which saves you only 1 hour per week, that’s over 50 hours/year saved — 2 full days.And each of the materials you’ll receive has been tested by highly productive people who get more done in a day than many of us get done in a week. As my Stanford communications professor told us (in response to engineers who mock Comm classes),“The value is not in difficulty of the work. It’s in the applicability.”“I’m big into analyzing data - this talk just gave me so much insight into the little systems I can build right now to help manage what I’m doing better. This is about getting rid of the clutter and mess we create because we’re busy, and building a few simple systems so wecanfocusonthethingswewanttodo.” -JonathanVaudreuil<br><strong>Q: “WhaT IF ThIs doesn’T Work For me?”</strong>A: Then ask for a refund. You have 60 days to ask for a 100% refund (I’ll even eat the credit-card processing fees). In fact, if you apply the material and don’t save one hour per day, send me a note for a refund. But only join if you’re ready to stop reading and start implementing.<strong>The boTTom lIne</strong>This is a quick reminder that the 48-hour clock on my Productivity Pack offer is running out. After midnight tomorrow, I’m taking the offer down and have no plans to make it publicly available again.If you’re done reading about time management and are ready to start saving time, check this out.Here’sthelink: Link -RamitP.S. If you had the chance to save an hour a day for a modest investment, would you take it? Now imagine there was no risk — that if it didn’t work, you’d get that investment back, no strings or catches. Would you do it?I know this material works because thousands of my readers have tested it and used the time saved to earn more money, spend more time with friends, go out, and use the freedom for the things they want to do. How will you use an extra hour a day?Here’sthelink—validuntil11:59pmtomorrownight: Link<br>“Ramit and Tim have a few awesome ingredients that made this and similar interviewswell worth my time:<strong>1. a naTural conversaTIon FloW ThaT Is Fun To lIsTen To and makes You Feel parT oF The conversaTIon.2. a lengThY Q and a porTIon3.

Ramit and Tim consistently help me find the nextmostusefulstepsformyentrepreneurialprojects!” -OrenPersing<br><br><br><strong>daY 5: look at this guy’s guilty email<br></strong>Hey <strong>name<br></strong>I just had a fascinating back-and-forth with one of my IWT readers. (If you’re curious,you should read this before 11:59pm PST tonight.)<br>Reader “Derek S.” responded to an email about buying my book.“I totally bought your book. Two years ago. I’m just reading it now. I’m on the budgeting chapter. My family is in dire need of a budget.”I responded: “got it. what took you two years?”<br>Now the fascinating part. Look at Derek’s response:What took me two years? The short answer: new job, new city, bought a new house, had a new baby.The long answer: I’m totally unfocused, with too many projects going on at once, all of them unfinished, and I’m a chronic professional procrastinator.I achieved <strong>none </strong>of my goals for last year. This year’s goals are more of the same. It’s already the end of March and I haven’t achieved a single one. I can’t take another year of this. My buzzword for this year was supposed to be <strong>Focus</strong>. I seem to keep up my energy and schedules for a week, max, and then fall off the wagon over and over, no matter what it is: losing weight, writing a book, sticking to a budget, saving money, learning a new skill – it’s always the same. I can’t maintain <strong>consIsTencY</strong>.I did Earn 1K last <strong>augusT </strong>and still haven’t earned a dime – I have yet to watch the last lesson. Just the very last one. Before that, I was up at 6a.m. doing the course before work, but it never lasts for long. I keep somehow sabotaging myself.I’m now writing a children’s book, but it’s been weeks since I last wrote. Same deal.I’ve been listening to Tony Robbins and Jim Roan and whatnot to try to get to the bottom of this and stay on track, but I even fall off the horse on <strong>ThaT</strong>,<br>and don’t follow through with the their exercises. I’m 40 now – I’ve got 20 years of bad habits and procrastinating to wash out.So there’s the long answer. Sigh. <strong>I WIll sorT ThIs ouT</strong>! And you <strong>have </strong>been helping <strong>a loT</strong>. I know <strong>WhaT </strong>I should do, I just need to keep <strong>doIng IT</strong>.”Derek’s answer is honest, frustrating, and heartbreaking at the same time.The most heartbreaking part is how he genuinely <strong>WanTs </strong>to be more focused and productive, yet he cannot. Unfortunately, his solution is to double down and “try harder.”<br>This email isn’t about making fun of Derek. <strong>everY </strong>one of us has a challenge in staying productive and focusing on the things that matter (me included).What’s frustrating is how our “pop psychology” world and American culture urge us to try harder — with phrases like “If you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything!” — totally ignoring decades of research on behavioral change.Of <strong>course </strong>you want to be more productive. So why is it so hard? As Scott Adams said, “Losers have goals. Winners have systems.”A few days ago, I ran a survey of 1,959 people on time management and productivity. Some results:<br><br>▶&nbsp; <strong>mosT people raTed Themselves as average aT TIme managemenT (5-6 ouT oF 10)<br></strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>over 2⁄3 oF responders saId TheY WasTe over 2 hours everY daY (ThaT’s 30 daYs per Year)<br></strong>▶&nbsp; <strong>common TIme sucks = Facebook, emaIl, InTerneT neWs<br></strong>When I asked them what <strong>doesn’T </strong>work, the most common responses were: makingendless lists and looking for perfect apps.Yet when I challenged you to think of techniques that <strong>do </strong>work, many of you were stumped. Let me be crystal clear: Top performers know of time management techniques that ordinary people do not.That’s why I’d like you to introduce systems into your life.Systems help you pre-decide what’s important to you — <strong>once </strong>— and then force you to stay focused. Instead of waking up every day and wondering what you should do... or opening up your email inbox and just sighing... you’ll have a clear picture of what to do BEFORE you ever log into email.You’ll focus on integrating these into your life so you’re not constantly “trying harder” to “catch up.”(It’s the same with money... while most people try to exercise their willpower each day by cutting back on lattes, IWT students know that building automated systems will save them hundreds of times what lattes will... automatically... <strong>and </strong>they can still buy what they love.)Once you integrate these systems into your daily life, you’ll feel guilt-free when you browse random websites or take a few breaks each day... because you know that during your productive time, you’re getting more done than virtually anyone else around you.Think of the simplest system you use — where you put your keys. Maybe it’s by the door, or in the kitchen. Yet it’s become a habit and you never think about it. You don’t have to<br>“try harder” to put the keys where they should be... it just works. It’s mindless. And it does what it needs to do.<strong>What if you could build a few simple time management systems into your life?</strong>The IWT Productivity Pack: Powerful Automation, Systems, and Productivity includes videos on integrating systems and psychological time-saving techniques into your life. I interview two people I call on for help — Tim Ferriss and Laura Roeder — who have helped me become insanely productive.You’ll learn the exact systems they use to stay productive... and how they integrate and automate these systems into their lives.Then, I’ve added several additional pieces of material into the course to dramatically change the way you think about productivity. You’ll “erase” years of conditioning (like the idea of “trying harder”) and use an entirely different mindset that top performers use to get 10x more done than ordinary people.Imagine waking up and knowing <strong>exacTlY </strong>which high-impact activities to do... and which to ignore.Imagine what you could do with the extra time. Have more energy to see friends after work? Work out in the morning? Take that trip you’ve been meaning to go on?Or just get in control of your life?Instead of listening to more of the same tired advice — “put your mind to it!” — you’ll be studying the masters of time management to learn how they do it... .and how you can integrate their best tested techniques directly into your daily schedule.And if it doesn’t work, simply ask for your money back — 100% of it. I have to earn my way into your life, and I stand behind each of my courses.Before you decide, ask yourself this:“If I decided to invest in myself today, what would life look like 2 weeks from now? How would I feel waking up every morning and knowing <strong>exacTlY </strong>what high-impact activities I should do... and what to ignore?”“<strong>oF course </strong>I want to save time. And I trust that your stuff works, Ramit. So what’s holding me back? Is it that I’m afraid I won’t commit the time? Or I don’t think this is exactly right for my situation?”“What if I only implemented <strong>halF </strong>of what’s in the course (saving me 3+ hours/ week... or 150 hours/year). What could I do with that time?”It’s up to you.<br><br>Decide between talking and talking about time management... or <strong>acTuallY </strong>integrating new systems into your life. There are key things that top performers know about time management that most people do not. Let me teach you the differences.You have enough information to make a decision. Now it’s time to pull the trigger.One last thing. As you know, I prohibit my readers from joining my flagship courses if they have credit card debt, a decision which costs me hundreds of thousands of dollars<br>a year — but is the right thing to do. However, because this Productivity Pack is a mini- course with a lower price point, you are allowed to join (even if you have CC debt). All I ask is that you focus on implementing the material in this mini-course and my book to pay off debt as rapidly as possible and grow your savings.This mini-course closes <strong>TonIghT </strong>at 11:59pm PST. There are no exceptions and I do not know when it will be available again.Join here: Link Thanks, -RamitP.S. If you don’t save at least an hour a day using this mini-course, write me for a full refund. But this mini-course on time management and productivity systems closes <strong>TonIghT </strong>at 11:59pm PST. Here’s that link again: Link<br><br></div><div></div>
