Not sure how to answer without coming across sale-sy, over the top technical or without twisting your tongue?<br><br></div><div>I know so many people who struggle to come up with a simple way to introduce themselves.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>I used to cringe when I noticed that people didn’t get it and gave me a blank “aha”.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>If you don’t have it together you might miss the opportunity to make a great first impression!<br><br></div><div>We all know that in today’s market it is all about standing out.<br><br></div><div>Your introduction is one of the most important elements in <a href="https://www.newhorizoncoaching.com.au/why-personal-branding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">your personal branding</a>. Whether you want to make a solid first impression in an interview, at a networking event or during a social event, you need to have it together.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>How to be approachable:<br><br>-dress for confidence! (something that makes YOU feel good &amp; add something unique/shows your personality)<br>-focus on feeling good/confident/open&nbsp;<br>-when you feel comfortable, people a drawn to you (without even knowing why!)<br>-open body language&nbsp;</div><ul><li>eye contact, glance around the room when you enter</li><li>posture - open arms / or direct everything to what you are interested in</li><li>relaxed mouth / jaw</li></ul><div>-NO ONE likes being rejected! Be kind to each other<br>-for the non-smilers/resting bitch face - go for relaxed mouth &amp; jaw<br><br><br>When talking:<br><br>What to say? =words:</div><div>-Start simple - Hi, how are you? I'm Elizabeth..and you are?<br>-Know a few easy conversation starters, so you are never at a loss for words:</div><ul><li>What's your story?</li><li>How / Why questions (ask (adj)interesting questions &amp; people think YOU are (adj) interesting)</li><li>Tell me more! (magic words!)</li><li>Mirror technique:<br>Repeat to go deeper - If someone mentions something that interests you, repeat it back to ask them for more information. "I went to Croatia last weekend and went camping with some friends."&nbsp;<br><br>-Question: Oh, do you like camping?&nbsp; - This mirroring can get people to open up in some very powerful ways</li></ul><div>-Statement: Wow - I haven't been camping in so long. It must have been great. - This reveals something about you &amp; shows a connection point, or something that you have in common</div><div><br>Most of these things are great with NEW people, but what about coworkers / family / people you already know...ask about future plans -<br>Asking about future plans is especially useful with people you already know &amp; see regularly (friends, co-workers, etc.)<br><br></div><div><br>It is an open question and always offers new topics.<br><br></div><div><br>I'm listening / interested:</div><ul><li>get closer (slight lean in / step closer) BECAREFUL&nbsp;</li><li>hold eye contact with someone you want to meet one second longer</li><li>react:<ul><li>growing smile</li><li>lift eyebrows (lightning fast!)</li><li>slight nod / head tilt (SUPER SUBTLE!!)</li></ul></li></ul><div><br>These are signals you can send and watch for in others.<br><br>These signals come naturally to most people, and I'm not suggesting that you FAKE it, but rather be aware of what you are doing/not doing and what signals you are sending. <br><br>A great example of this in action having dental work done...usually people who don't feel comfortable with their smile, for whatever reason, hold back, close their lips / cover their mouth / DON'T smile much. Then once the dental work is complete - boom! They are like a whole new person that just can't stop beaming their pearly whites! Don't believe me, ask any one who's had braces!<br><br>before we close, I want to say a few words about leadership:<br>Introduce yourself to someone<br><br>leaning towards someone<br>arms open<br>smile / expressive face<br><br>A few special notes / add ons:<br><br>1. cues of power / leadership:<br>-smile less<br>-interrupt (intentionally / unintentionally = vocal power)<br>-hold eye contact more when speaking / less when listening<br>-stand still - move only with intention<br>-hold head still - move only with intention<br><br>2. How to answer, "So, tell me, what do you do?"<br>3 parts:<br>a) I'm a _______________ ( insert what you do / job title or general description)<br>-Career change?<strong><br></strong><br></div><div>For the past several years, I worked as a _______________. But recently, I made<br><br></div><div>a big shift. These days, I’m doing _______________.<br><br></div><div><strong>between jobs?<br></strong><br></div><div>I’m in between “official job titles” right now.<br><br></div><div>But what I love most in the world is_______________.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>b) Who do you help?<br>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>I work with____________________________<br></strong><br></div><div>(<em>the person who’s problem you solve. Could be your manager or customers</em>)<br><br></div><div>Examples:<br><br></div><ul><li>Could be people in a specific position: CEO’s, Executives, Senior Managers, Project manager</li><li>Departments or companies: Government departments, not for profits, financial institutions etc</li><li>Could be a combination: Project managers in financial institutions, CFO’s in Accounting firms, Partners in legal companies</li><li>Could be specific target groups: Mums who are entrepreneurs</li></ul><div>c) Which problems do you help solving?<br><br></div><div><strong>helping them_________________________________<br></strong><br></div><div>(<em>insert a couple of words describing the big picture of what you do</em><strong>)<br></strong><br></div><div><br>d) Which results do you help achieving?<br><br></div><div><strong>So that they __________________________<br></strong><br></div><div><em>(insert concise description of the result the person who’s problem you solve experience</em><strong><em>).<br></em></strong><br></div><div>Try to keep it authentic and conversational – get rid of anything too salesy or that just doesn’t feel like you.<br><br></div><div><strong>Here are some examples to help you create your own:<br></strong><br></div><div><em>I’m a Marketing Strategist and I work with CEO’s helping them create a link between Marketing and Sales so that they can increase engagement with their clients and sell more products.<br></em><br></div><div><em>I’m an IT security specialist and I work with executives in financial institutions helping them ensure the security of the infrastructure and data so that their clients are confident their money is safe.<br></em><br></div><div></div>
