      <h1>How To Navigate The Dreaded Networking Event Successfully</h1><div><br></div><div><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kimberly A. Whitler</a>Senior Contributor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/cmo-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CMO Network</a></div><ul><li><br></li><li><br></li><li><br></li></ul><div><br></div><div>Shutterstock</div><div><br>Navigating the dreaded networking event can be daunting. Walking into an event on your own, staring at a sea of faces, and knowing that you are there on a mission can be ominous for some. To generate insight on how to turn trepidation into success, I turned to Ivan Misner, founder of BNI.com (the world’s largest networking organization), and the author of <em>Networking Like a Pro.&nbsp;<br></em><br></div><div><strong><br>Kimberly Whitler:</strong> Why is networking so challenging?<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Ivan Misner:</strong> Networking can be nerve-wracking. As a professor myself, I know that not all business schools teach courses on networking skills and many students leave the university without a clue about how to network. One of the biggest mistakes people make when networking is that they use it as a <em>business</em> building opportunity instead of as a <em>relationship-</em>building opportunity. Whenever I begin a keynote at a networking event I ask two important questions. First, “How many of you are here hoping to possibly sell something?” Usually the majority, if not the whole room, raises their hands. Then I ask, “How many of you are hoping to buy something?” Nobody raises their hands. Usually not even one single person. This phenomenon is what I call, The Networking Disconnect. Business people show up to events looking to promote or sell something but almost nobody is there to buy something. This is why networking goes off of the rails; people use it as a face to face cold-calling opportunity instead of a relationship building opportunity.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fkimberlywhitler%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F02%2FIvan-Misner_Podium.jpg" width="960" height="639"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div>Ivan Misner, BNI.com BNI.COM</div><div><strong><br>Whitler:</strong> What can businesspeople do to manage networking events more effectively?<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Misner:</strong> Most importantly they need to start seeing networking not as a sales process but as a referral process. The foundation of everything I teach starts with the VCP Process, which stands for visibility, credibility, and profitability. First you have to be visible in the community. Networking is more about farming then about hunting. People tend to jump over this. You have to know who you are and what you do. Credibility follows when people start to believe that you are good at what you do. Then, and only then, can you get to profitability and this happens because people in your network become willing to refer you to other people. This relationship building is not about what you know or even who you know, it’s about <em>how well</em>you know each other. Businesspeople get out into the real world and they are desperate for business, but Desperation is not referable and people are not going to refer you until you are credible.<br><br></div><div>Today In: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/cmo-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Leadership</a></div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>Whitler:</strong> So how do you start becoming more visible?<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Misner:</strong> It’s about touchpoints. Establishing credibility is the same as establishing a friendship. If we meet once and don’t talk for 6 months, it’s unlikely we are friends. You need to go out for coffee occasionally. Or start a conversation based on a social media post that you saw on their LinkedIn page. Comment on things that they post or invite them to comment on a blog that you wrote. Build these relationships over time. Social capital is like financial capital, you cannot make a withdrawal before you make a deposit. You have to invest time in the relationship. When you find someone you want to network with ask them, “What can I do for you?”<br><br></div><div>PROMOTED</div><div><strong>The Samsung Frame TV Is Currently $500 Off&nbsp;</strong></div><div>Grads of Life BRANDVOICE<strong>More Than What’s On Paper: Dedication Comes With Rewards&nbsp;</strong></div><div>Civic Nation BRANDVOICE<strong>A Dream That Continues To Unfold: My Experience As A DACA Student&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br>Whitler:</strong> What can MBA students or businesspeople do to have a more successful networking experience?<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Misner:</strong> There are a number of things. Don’t sell and don’t pitch. Everybody is doing that. You want to embrace discomfort. If you are uncomfortable, you are in the right place. Don’t be a sycophant to people you look up to. Don’t puppy-dog lick them to death. People know when they are being hit up for something. As much as possible, try and make a relevant connection. Use the context of the event to do so. Here is an example. When I met Jack Canfield, the famous creator of the <em>Chicken Soup for the Soul</em> book series, it was at a book signing for speakers. The problem was that the audience was still at dinner, and no one was at the signing. So I shared a story with him about a book signing I did where the only person who showed up was my mother. She acted like she was a fan and made such a big deal at the signing that people started crowding around to meet me. It was an incredible embarrassment that turned into a huge success. Jack laughed so hard that it helped us establish a relationship. I didn’t ask him for anything. I said it was a pleasure meeting him and that if there was anything I could ever do for him, I’d be happy to. Jack later invited me to join his leadership council.<br><br></div><div><br>A good networker should have 2 ears and one mouth and use them proportionately. You want to follow the branch of the conversation. If at all possible, add value. For example, if you know ahead of time what topics someone is interested in, do some research on a new article in that field. Say, “I recently read an interesting article on that topic, have you seen that? I will send you a link, what’s your email?”<br><br></div><div><br>The bottom line is, if you add value in a way that serves other people you will become a successful, and profitable, networker.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Synopsis<br><br></div><div>Lately Dr. Misner has seen a lot of people who have been using VCP like it’s a formula: Visibility + Credibility = Profitability.<br><br></div><div>VCP is a referral process, not a sales process. If the majority of your clients aren’t giving you referrals, then you are only at Credibility with your clients, not at Profitability. It’s possible that you can have a lot of Visibility and a lot of Credibility, but NOT have Profitability. Rather than a formula, VCP is a continuum.<br><br></div><div>Once you achieve Credibility (and not before), you have to start <strong>asking for referrals</strong> in order to achieve Profitability. Profitability does not result automatically from Visibility and Profitability.<br><br></div><div>Brought to you by <a href="http://networkingnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Networking Now</strong></a>.<br><br></div><div><strong><em>Complete Transcript of Episode 420 –<br></em></strong><br></div><div><strong>Priscilla</strong>:<br>Hello everyone and welcome back to the Official BNI Podcast, brought to you by NetworkingNow.com, which is the leading site on the net for networking downloadables. I am Priscilla Rice, and I am coming to you from Live Oak Recording Studio in Berkeley, California. I am joined on the phone today by the Founder and the Chief Visionary Officer of BNI, Dr. Ivan Misner. Hello, Ivan. How are you today?<br><br></div><div><strong>Ivan</strong>:<br>I am doing great, Priscilla. I have, I think, an interesting topic for today.<br><br></div><div><strong>Priscilla</strong>:<br>Yeah. What does that mean?<br><br></div><div><strong>Ivan</strong>:<br>V+C does not equal P. It is about the VCP process. Before you go, oh gosh, Ivan is talking about VCP, hear me out. I have been seeing a lot of people- members and Director Consultants who have been using VCP like it is a formula. “Visibility plus credibility equals profitability.”<br><br></div><div>Let me give you 30 seconds, no more than 60 seconds, of what VCP is just in case you are listening and you are new member and you haven;t heard me talk about this. VCP is the foundation of everything that I teach. If you don’t get this right, nothing else you do in BNI will work. VCP stands for visibility, credibility, and profitability.<br><br></div><div>You first have to be visible in the community. That is when people know who you are and what you do. Over time, you establish credibility. Credibility is when people know who you are, what you do, and they know that you are good at it. And then and only then can you get to profitability. People know who you are, what you do, that you are good at it, and they are willing to pass you referrals on an ongoing reciprocal basis.<br><br></div><div>Now it is important to note that it is a referral process, not a sales. process. When I ask audiences, “Where are you with your clients?” They almost always say, ” I am at profitability because they are my clients.”<br><br></div><div>Not true. Not true at all because it is a referral process. Are the majority of your clients giving you referrals? Most people will be honest and say no, not a majority of them.<br><br></div><div>Well, you are only at credibility with your own clients because this is a referral process, not a sales process.<br><br></div><div>Alright. You have just gotten a one minute lesson on the VCP process. What I want to talk about is the fact that VCP is not a formula. VCP is not a formula. It is a process. VCP is a continium. A process is a systematic series of actions that are directed to some end. A continuous action or operation or a series of changes.<br><br></div><div>That is different from a formula. You know, one plus two equals three. Well, in VCP, even if it were a mathematical formula, that wouldn’t be the formula. One plus two equals three. No, actually, with VCP, if it were a mathematical formula, it would be more like one plus two equals 10 because the return on investment of time really kicks in when you get to the profitability.<br><br></div><div>It is not about visibility and then adding credibility. And then when you add credibility, you get profitability. It doesn’t work that way. You can have a lot visibility and a lot of credibility and have no profitability at the end of that.<br><br></div><div>For example, your clients, just as we were saying. You have visibility with your clients. You have credibility with your clients. They wouldn’t be buying your products or services if you didn’t have credibility. Yet, many of them aren’t giving you referrals.<br><br></div><div>So if it were a mathematical formula and you nailed it with visibility and nailed it with credibility, one would assume then that you would absolutely have profitability and it doesn’t work that way, Instead, it is a continuum. You have to move through visibility. You have to move through credibility. And only then can you get into profitability, where you are generating business.<br><br></div><div>So look at VCP as a continuum that you are working through, not a mathematical formula that if you do all of these, you are going to magically have profitability. Does that make sense?<br><br></div><div><strong>Priscilla</strong>:<br>Yes, it makes sense. And you might have to stimulate profitability by encouraging people or asking people for referrals.<br><br></div><div><strong>Ivan</strong>:<br>Do you think! Absolutely! You are absolutely correct! So while you are in credibility, where it really goes wrong is when people start asking for the referral and they are only as visibility. It drives me crazy when people say that it never hurts to ask, right? Wrong. It does hurt to ask, actually, when you are asking for a referral before you are at any kind of credibility.<br><br></div><div>So, yeah, you are right. You ask for those referrals when you are at credibility and that is what leads to the profitability. But you can’t just assume that when you have visibility and you have credibility that it equals profitability. It doesn’t.<br><br></div><div>It’s a minor point. Even though it is a minor point, I think it has significant impact because I think people are starting to get the impression that if they just have V and then they get to C, that it is automatic that they will get profitability.<br><br></div><div>What you just said is correct. You have to actually do some things to move it into profitability.<br><br></div><div><strong>Priscilla</strong>:<br>Right, which is what I hope we will cover in a future podcast about how to reward referrals.<br><br></div><div><strong>Ivan</strong>:<br>That is a great topic. Let’s do that on one of the upcoming topics. I think you came up with that idea having read World’s Best Known Marketing Secret. You saw me talking about that.<br><br></div><div><strong>Priscilla</strong>:<br>Yeah. I think it fits in with this podcast really well.<br><br></div><div><strong>Ivan</strong>:<br>Alright. We will put it in a future podcast, I promise.<br><br></div><div><strong>Priscilla</strong>:<br>Okay, great.<br><br></div><div><strong>Ivan</strong>:<br>Alright. So those of you who are talking about VCP, remember it is a continuum. V with effort leads to C and with effort, that leads to P for profitability. It is not V+C=P. Alright, that is it for today.<br><br></div><div><strong>Priscilla</strong>:<br>Okay. Thank you so much, Dr. Misner. I think that is it for this week. I would just like to remind you, the listeners, that this podcast has been brought to you by NetworkingNow.com, which is the leading site on the net for networking downloadables. Thank you so much for listening. This is Priscilla Rice and we hope you will join us next week for another exciting episode of the Official BNI Podcast.</div>
