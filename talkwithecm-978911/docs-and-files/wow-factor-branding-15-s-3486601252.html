      <div><br>SUCCESS SERIES&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong><br>WOW FACTOR BRANDING&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><br>a workbook<br>&nbsp;by Karen Salmansohn&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong><br>The 15 questions in this workbook took me about 30 years to write, perfect and polish!&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>How’s that?<br>&nbsp;It’s because I started my career in advertising - about 30 years ago.&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>I loved being a junior copywriter - merging psychology with catchy words and stylish graphics. My passions paid off. In my first 6 months in the ad business I got awarded a CLIO.&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>I then quickly went on to become a Senior VP award winning ad writer/creative director - at age 27. I worked for respected places like J. Walter Thompson, McCann Erickson, Young &amp; Rubicam, MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, E!, L’Oreal, Revlon, and then some!&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>Although I was doing super well in advertising, in my late 20’s I began threatening to quit.&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>I no longer wanted to use my writing and design skills to sell toothpaste. I now wanted to apply my skills to help people to think in new ways.&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>My parents kept talking me out of quitting, saying: “How can you quit when you’re doing so well?”&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><strong><br>Introduction&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>I explained that if I were doing lousy, I’d probably stay - just to prove something to myself – or out of fear.&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>But I figured if I could do so well at something I was no longer passionate about, then I might do far better at something I enthusiastically wanted to do.&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><strong><br>In my late 20’s I finally did quit advertising.&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>Since leaving the ad world, I’ve become a multi-best selling author and award winning designer – with over 1.5 million fans.&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>I credit my background in advertising for achieving this success.<br>&nbsp;I often joke that starting off in advertising gave me an honorary MBA in Branding.&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>I applied all I learned in those ad big agencies with the big publishing houses who took me on as as an author.&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>I decisively chose not to merely think of myself as a writer. I thought of myself as an entrepreneur of books - and built a brand around myself - using the same 15 questions I am giving you in this workbook.&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><strong><br>These 15 questions are powerful to think about your brand.&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>In fact, I still ask myself these 15 questions - over and over - to make sure I am keeping my books and brand fresh and thriving.&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>It’s not by accident that I became known for writing and designing “self-help for people who would never be caught dead doing self-help.”&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>I came up with this “Unique Selling Point” mission and brand identity while answering these 15 questions!&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>It’s also because of these dynamic 15 questions that I decided to create </span><strong>MastersInLife.com </strong><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">- my sequel digital learning site - spawned from </span><strong>NotSalmon.com! </strong><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(I credit questions 5, 10, 11 and 12 for launching this inspiring&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>site with its fun and life-changing courses!)&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>Without further ado, let’s give you this workbook to do! Read on...and write your responses in the spaces below the questions!&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>Big hug, Karen&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><strong><br>1. How does your brand help to solve fears or problems? Basically – what are the negatives people have in not coming to you?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>2. What are you bursting at the seams to work on each day? How does your signature strength help your brand to solve people’s fears or problems?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>3. What is a trend (or predicted trend) that your brand is riding?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>4. What special features does your brand have - which are unique? How can you play up these features more?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>5. Why wouldn’t people come to your brand? What’s your “Devil’s Advocate List”? How can you convince people otherwise?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>6. What media write ups and videos promote your brand best? Why? How can you create more of your best of your best?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>7. I say: “Whypower builds Willpower!” Why does it matter to you that your brand is a huge success? Why are you passionate about your brand’s growth?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>8. What do you fail to do on a regular basis? Where do you need to get stronger? How are you at handling stress, failure and organization? Where might you improve?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>9. How are you a “United Family of Employees”? Who you you trust and respect to delegate work which is not your signature strength? How might you improve your support system?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>10. What’s your reputation now? How do you want to be seen in the next 1 year, 5 years, 10 years?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>11. Do what I call a “Learn-around!” What have you learned in the last few years that has improved what you do? What’s your next “Learn- around” assignment? Get honest!&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>12. The world is changing...change with it. How has the world changed – so you must do what you do differently?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>13. Who is your intended audience? Describe them as if they are individuals - not a subgroup. For example, name 3 individuals - and describe them.&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>14. If a customer were using google to find a brand like yours, what words or phrases would they use? Are you using these words on your site and marketing?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>15. Every brand needs an exciting origin story. What's yours? If you were on Oprah, what might she say to make you cry happy tears? How can you weave this story into your origin story?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>When you think about money and success, what thoughts come to mind?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>For far too many people, these words bring up fear, anxiety, and regret!&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>However, money and success can bring up positive associations instead -- if you learn specific tools, principles and habits.&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>I'd love to share my success strategies with you!&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>Get my insider secrets! Learn how I became a multi-best-selling author – with over 1 million books sold – as well as a columnist for Oprah., Psychology Today, CNN, etc...&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>I will also share the “rich-uals” of Millionaire Masters - from a variety of professions! Learn what they do daily - so you can do it too!&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><br>Lower your </span><strong>anxiety!<br></strong><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">Increase your </span><strong>profits!<br></strong><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">Come hang out with me at </span><strong>Masters In Life! </strong><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">xo Karen&nbsp;<br></span><br></div><div><strong><br>Epilogue&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div>&nbsp;| <br>&nbsp;| <strong>Turn your passions into a bigger paycheck! </strong>Get my insider secrets!
