      <div><strong><br>Subject Line: You’re Invited To My Webinar Go LIVE With Ease<br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>Email Copy:&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Hey [first name]!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>This pandemic has been corona-CRAZY because everything keeps changing, and changing again. And now protests have erupted in over 75 cities across the USA and the world. If you're like me, you've spent nights watching, gathering information, trying to make sense of it all. Trying to make the best choices for now and the future - for society, health, your finances, your life.&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe you are losing sleep or worry about the greater impact this will have, but the biggest frustration I find is that heavy feeling of just being stuck.&nbsp;<br><br>Most people feel stuck. Professionally, socially, physically stuck. It is so difficult to know what to do to keep moving forward with our lives and find growth opportunities that don't feel icky or scammy.<br><br>I have to admit, I feel strange and callous reaching out to two of our upcoming speakers living in the USA. Imagine starting a conversation like this, "Our nation is imploding, there is violence outside your door, can we talk about the content that you'd like to present in August for our webinar?"&nbsp;<br><br>And it is not just in the USA, I did an informal survey during a webinar last week &amp; biggest complaints that I heard from professionals are:</div><ul><li>how to identify new opportunities, real opportunities</li><li>fear of trying something new, especially something that I don't have the education or experience for</li><li>finding the right market for your service and then getting responses!</li></ul><div>Frustrating, isn't it?&nbsp;<br>That's probably why most people are struggling right now. Most of us don't know how to get your message out there in front of the exact people who want to hear it. Right?<br><br></div><div>Believe me, I know how frustrating that can be. Been there, done that. <br><br>That's where this webinar will come in - to help you get your voice / message / service / whatever you are offering in front of the exact people who need and want it - the exact people who are searching desperately to find a solution to the problem that you can solve. <br><br>I’m going to explain, step-by-step, everything you need to know to make live content that matters &amp; 10X, 50X - 100X your reach <strong>without overwhelm</strong>, so you can get the right message to the right people, especially now, when things are so unstable.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Sign up for my free webinar, Go LIVE With Ease today, and let's get you started with creating valuable content and connecting directly with your audience.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Here are the webinar details:&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br>●&nbsp; <strong>Title: </strong>Go LIVE With Ease</div><div><br>●&nbsp; <strong>Date &amp; time: </strong>[Date &amp; Time of the Webinar]&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>●&nbsp; <strong>Where: </strong>Click here to register {link}<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Here's what you'll learn during this free webinar:&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div>In this webinar, you’ll get proven methods to conquer your inner critic and shine in front of your audience. We will be pulling back the curtain on tactics to build your confidence and genuinely connect with others digitally even if you <em>hate</em> talking to a camera. We’ll also cover:<br><br></div><ul><li>The limitations brought on by this pandemic - how to embrace the struggle and create unique opportunities for you to shine</li><li>#1 struggle holding professionals back and limiting their career right now - and it’s not what you think!</li><li>Mindset Detox - Melt away toxic thought patterns &amp; create a clear path to getting the attention you deserve</li><li>Mini-challenges - Simple, fun action steps to conquer your inner critic &amp; turbo-charge your digital presence</li></ul><div><em><br>... and much more!&nbsp;<br></em><br></div><div><br>Click here to sign up for the free Go LIVE With Ease webinar.
