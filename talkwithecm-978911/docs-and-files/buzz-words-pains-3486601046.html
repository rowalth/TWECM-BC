And I'd love to have the amount to energy you have in a live stream/webinar</li><li>I would love to use marvellous words and persuading phrases that can turn no to YES.</li><li>&nbsp;I'd love to have more entertainer - to make things fun &amp; get people energized.</li><li>Want to engage my audience so they like, comment, share (and BUY)</li><li>Want to engage more and unborify the speech and sales process not to sound so corporate(sy)</li><li>&nbsp;I want the skills that create more engagement on my posts without having to ask people to drop an emoji or tell them two words they have to write. I don’t want to tell people what to do but entice them into engaging, but my current issue is that I get people consuming the content... but then it’s often so thought provoking that they don’t know what to say and need some time (their words, not mine). I love that people want to sit with my words but not for my engagement!!<br>Actually, I also want to feel less impostery and fearful about selling and CTAs. My go-to way has been to either go all out and yell “throw money at me” (entertainer streak) in a funny way OR be super casual about it. I really don’t fit with any of the ways I’ve learned in courses etc but I also know some of it comes from imposter syndrome and fear.</li><li>Be more entertaining, and a better wordsmith</li><li>Get hoards of people to buy my stuff. I make really good stuff and I just keep getting crickets. Although one cricket stopped chirping and bought my last offer thanks to SOL:FT!!! Yay!</li><li>Create an engaged following - and connection - growing my coaching to 80% high ticket 1:1 so connection and follow through closing sales calls</li><li>I would love to be unforgettable and in demand (while being compassionate and caring).</li><li>I would love to be more engaging and entertaining&nbsp;</li><li>Dear goddesses grant me the gift of patience (and get off my annoying high horse. Because I HATE explaining what it is I do for people. and it’s costing me clients.<br>Ready to do the work.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><br>******************************************************************************************<br>Persuasive ads and emails and compelling sales letters.

      <div>INtroverts in business = It used to be really hard. I started by looking at the presentations that other people did and what made the difference between the ones that were really good and the ones that weren't. What I discovered was that the difference between a presenter that is meh or bad and one that's amazing is that amazing presenter don't care what other people think of them. They put on a performance they can enjoy for themselves and don't think about their audience in that way.</div><div>So I tried "acting" out my presentations vs. just giving them. Which worked well enough, but what if I wasn't in the mood to be social or present-y, or compelling?</div><div>I learned a few body hacks that helped over the years. One is to use super(wo)man poses or power poses before I had to be social. (I learned this from a Ted Talk). The other is to pump myself up, I use to do a cheer, by myself, jumping up and down like a crazy person clapping and saying, "to be enthusiastic, you must be enthusiastic". It looks dumb. It feels dumb. But damnit if it doesn't actually work.</div><div>The last thing I learned is that, oddly enough, it's not about me. If I'm meeting someone for the first time, I have a few questions in my backpocket to get them talking about themselves. This serves two purposes: 1. I don't have to talk, 2. They walk away with good feelings about me because I was interested in them.</div><div>It's also not about me in business. I'm always willing to go the extra mile for someone else other than myself. So when I think about a client or a potential client that is sitting around wasting hours or days at work when they don't have to, all because they didn't know about how to create systems in their business to free up their time and energy, then it makes it easier to reach out, post the thing, create a blog post (I just started posting some very real, very personal things on my blog recently) because if I'm helping one other person, then I'm going to do it.</div><div>Hope this helps <bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t75/1/16/1f618.png" width="16" height="16"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">
