I wiggled with excitement, "Pick me! Pick me!" I thought.<br><br>We were learning about impromptu speeches.<br><br>After my name was called, I jumped up out of my seat. <br>I felt excited, adrenaline pumping through my skinny 10 year old veins. My heart started beating a little bit faster. I skipped to the front of the room.<br>Then I slowly turned around &amp; faced the class. A big smile speed across my face. Here I was, at the front. <br>I could feel everyone's eye's on me. <br><br><br>My teacher leaned back &amp; smiled. He said, "Your topic is....Why girls are better than boys. Begin."<br>....<br>My jaw dropped.<br>I took one short breath. I was nervous and I didn't want to leave too much silence.<br>My mind went blank. I blinked twice. I starting talking, I needed to say something, anything, and repeated the topic I was given. <br>"Why Girls are Better than Boys."<br><br>gulp, my heart stopped beating, my face started turning bright red, <br><br>"This an interesting topic....uh...because....well, One thing about this is that...um"<br>My mouth felt dry and chalky - I had no idea what to say. I was stuck. I didn't know what to do, I remember opening my mouth to speak, but nothing came out. <br><br>After a few more failed attempts to deliver my speech, I sat down, totally disappointed &amp; devastated.<br><br>I felt so small - humiliated.<br><br>For the rest of the class, I sat in my seat, looking down at my hands and tried my best to hold back my tears. I felt so embarrassed. <br><br>Two big things happened that day:<br>1. I learned that some people can be jerks - total jerks. Take this teacher - setting a little girl up for failure in front of the entire class. Sadly, he's not the only one. <br>2. I made a promise to myself - I had to make a change.&nbsp; I never wanted to feel that way again. I knew that I wanted to go from a flustered, tongue tied little girl struggling to find words to a confident speaker that people want to hear.<br><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 228, 247);">Second Pitfall and Breakthrough<br></span><br><em style="background-color: rgb(250, 247, 133);">And so I began the long process of learning </em>how to speak well and connect authentically with people. What I realized along the way is that nobody wants to feel small or stupid.&nbsp; It's not about the impromptu speeches, or even key note presentations. It's about being able to connect with others and inspiring others to take action. It's about confidently walking into a room knowing that when you speak, people will listen. Now when I make eye contact, I can relax and smile, because I know that people heard my message and take me seriously.&nbsp;<br><br>How would that feel?<br><br></div><div>Today I am combining what I've learned into TK</div><div><br></div><div><br>Offer -<br>Now, I want to combine my knowledge and coaching successes into one package and share it with you in my course - Start Your Conversation With Success!<br><br>This course includes is my proven system to get unstuck, overcome your fears &amp; speak confidently in English to communicate beyond your current language level &amp; reach your professional goals.</div><div><br></div><div>Start Your Conversation With Success<br>What you get:<br><br></div><ul><li>4 weekly small group sessions with me&nbsp;<ul><li>This is where we meet together, face to face, and systematically go through each of the steps in my method and apply them to your exact situation and drivers for success.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>unlimited practice time within our private online community<ul><li>This is where you get direct access to our dedicated community to test out new skills and practice in both 1:1 and group conversations.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Weekly challenges and activities for outside the classroom<ul><li>With new challenges and activities each week, I guide you to not only solidify what you know, but also to stretch your abilities and charge your confidence through success.</li></ul></li><li>Confidence boosting activities</li><li>Personalized vocabulary enhancers&nbsp;</li><li>Engaging emails, worksheets &amp; much more&nbsp;<ul><li>With a focus on building your skills and confidence, every aspect of this course directly linked to you and your personal progress.&nbsp;</li><li>No matter where you are on your journey to success, I will show you exactly what to do step by step to get there.</li></ul></li></ul><div>In this course, you'll get my STRATEGY&nbsp; - not more grammar rules!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>Answer Objections -<br><br><br><strong>1.
