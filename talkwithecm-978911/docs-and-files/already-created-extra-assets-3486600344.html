      <div>1. Conversation Playbook 5 Keys</div><ul><li>So, you've met, you've started talking and now what? This is a guide for keeping a conversation going and reviving conversations that have taken a wrong turn. This is not about starting or ending conversations - see my How to talk to Anyone guide.</li><li>#1 - Ask open-ended questions.&nbsp;<ul><li>So, you are from Chicago. Do you like it there? vs How do you like Chicago? I'm curious to hear more about it!</li><li>Why? to dig deeper</li></ul></li><li>Look for commonalities - things they like to encourage them to open up &amp; talk more</li><li>Revival questions - here we are looking to save a conversation that has died or completely change the direction of the conversation, and these questions dig for stories<ul><li>Group - so how do you know each other?</li><li>individual - What's your story? SO OPEN -Most people don't know how to respond to the question, so what do I do for work? Or what do I do for fun? (listen to their tone of voice / expression &amp; you'll probably know which one they prefer to talk about)</li><li>Asking for advice / tips</li></ul></li><li>Ask about future plans - especially good with people you already know &amp; see often, co-workers, etc. it is open, but always new.&nbsp;</li><li>Repeat to go deeper - If someone mentions something that interests you, repeat it back to ask them for more information. "I went to Croatia last weekend and went camping with some friends."&nbsp;<ul><li>With a question: Oh, do you like camping?&nbsp; - this mirroring can get people to open up in some very powerful ways.&nbsp;</li><li>With a statement: because you don't want to ask too many questions and make the person feel interrogated! Wow - I haven't been camping in so long. It must have been great. This reveals something about you &amp; shows a connection point, or something that you have in common.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><div>2 How to talk to anyone</div><ul><li>Same for professional - business meetings, networking, colleagues</li><li>social - parties, new friends, meeting the in-laws for the first time (!)</li><li>A - set the intention - to guide conversation why are you there? before you even enter the room - what is your game plan?<ul><li>have a good time</li><li>find more clients</li><li>learn something&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>B - Approach - First impressions NOT first words, first LOOK<ul><li>open body language</li><li>hands out (not in pockets / crossed), shoulders down &amp; back, eye contact / smile</li><li>#1 - Hi, how are you? I'm Elizabeth.&nbsp;</li><li>A genuine compliment - Great presentation! Nice bag...not necessary...</li></ul></li><li>B2 - Open for talking<ul><li>check your body position - people talking to each other (head/shoulders/toes - we physically demonstrate our attention - open vs closed)</li><li>standing around, awkward - check your phone (I've done that!) BUT = vicious cycle (closed body language - head/shoulders down...)</li><li>get a drink - have something in your hand = something to do, but not as off putting as a cell phone</li><li>Go to the watering hole - this is the place where animals regularly drink - a meeting space. As humans, we are not so different,&nbsp;<ul><li>at work, people tend to meet around the water cooler, coffee machine,&nbsp;</li><li>at home - kitchen</li><li>party/ networking event - by the food / bar! They come out (demo- hands full) Where do I go??</li></ul></li><li>So, since you just got a drink, stay there &amp; you can be a friendly face, "Hi, How are you? What did you get? Isn't this food great!"&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>C - Oh! Moments (TK-own word)<ul><li>micro-expression - eyebrow raise, break out of the meh's</li><li>Examples:<ul><li>meeting the in-laws // looking for things that you have in common, topics to connect...while talking, wait for the OH! moment (Oh! you have a garden!) (even a mini-mini one), then you know that you've hit it! You can follow that topic and go deeper.</li><li>Clients // sales, talking, making a pitch, presenting common problems &amp; the solutions your product offers - but as your speaking watch for the OH! - you know that you have their interest :)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>D - Exits - End note / last impression, psychologically speaking, this is really important (lasting impression, the feeling that you leave the person with)<ul><li>Future focus - What are you doing later today / this weekend / next week? Mark a change in the conversation and To shift the thinking of both parties.</li><li>Thank for conversation / wish the best for future plans</li></ul></li></ul><div>3. Story Map</div><ul><li>Who: hero/goal/motivation</li><li>Situation:&nbsp; where / when</li><li>Struggle: What is holding you back? Try/fail cycles</li><li>Crisis: darkest moment</li><li>Climax: best if self-saving</li><li>Resolve: return home changed</li></ul><div><br><br></div><div></div>
