      <div>Quick Launch <br><br><strong>Mon - hook - grab their attention</strong><br>20 cool things you can learn right now<br>The Hidden Job Market<br><br>Austria - hidden job market - shocking stuff!<br>Have you heard about the hidden job market? <br>75% of the jobs are never advertised!!! Recent studies show that companies only fill about 25% of their vacant positions through a public hiring process. The vast majority of (especially) higher paid jobs are filled through referrals - or better said networking activities. <br><br>So if you, or someone you know, is looking for a job and sending out piles of CVs, you know how daunting the process can be. Some people call it a numbers game, where the only way to get hired is to flood the market with your applications. Others say that networking is the way to go, but it can be difficult to even know where to start. Honestly, with today's hiring practices and new digitization trends a lot of the rules are changing. <br><br>But don't lose hope, there is a lot you can do right now to help differentiate yourself from other applicants. <br><br>If you are curious about increasing your own chances on the hidden job market and you are ready to unlock your networking skills, check out my post:<strong> How 30 Seconds Can Change Your Life!<br></strong><br>This post is about a friend of mine who landed the job of her dreams without even sending a single CV!

Walking around with another student, they visited booths, picked up brochures from different companies &amp; gathered information about career opportunities. They both had similar interests and skills. At one booth, her friend opened her mouth &amp; spoke, shared her CV &amp; left with the business card of the contact person at the company. Sue was flabbergasted, how did that happen? "She got the contact &amp; I have nothing!"<br><br>Has this ever happened to you? Two people with similar skills and experience, but gets the job and the other leaves empty handed.<br><br>In the story above, it is all about networking - reaching out and making a connection with another person.</span><br><br>The reality of CV overload:<br><br>With so many job seekers flooding the market with CVs, employers can receive anywhere between 75 and 250 applications per job posting. Most employers use ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) to digitally screen and filter applications down to a manageable pile. The reality is that most CVs are deleted by computer software without ever being read by an HR person or hiring manager.
