      <div>Hii =)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>First of all: THANK YOU so much for this great opportunity! For the effort and energy you’re putting in these kinds of activities involving the whole community! From what I saw it was a great experience for everyone.</div><div>And of course a big THANKS to Stefan - who was just the right person for the job - for joining in so spontaneously =)&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>here comes my Feedback to you, Elizabeth:</div><div>- I think you did a great job arranging the general framework for this to happen: the Info-Mails, the meeting, the feedback-forms. You were very clear in what you expected from us, concerning commitment, procedure, etc. That’s very important!</div><div><br><br></div><div>- Also the “you-can-do-it” attitude helped a lot in a moment, where I already was a bit nervous ;)</div><div><br><br></div><div>- Time was veeery short, but, well, that was part of the challenge I guess ;) I thought it very good that you took care of sticking to the schedule and announcing the start and beginning of each lesson to provide a clear general framework. It also gave us the chance to focus more on our teaching.</div><div><br><br></div><div>- The mixed levels were a big challenge! I would have liked to challenge the advanced dancers more (and I would have been prepared for that) but I didn’t want to overburden the beginners. And I’m not experienced enough to do both at the same time ;)&nbsp; So maybe next time we could build level-related groups to be able to respond better to our students.</div><div><br><br></div><div>- As for the meeting’s timing intersecting with class: I think the meeting was very important; also to bring us all together and share our ideas of the whole thing. For me personally it would have been OK to do it after class (maybe upstairs to have some privacy) and start the whole action a bit later.</div><div>I also felt, that the first group didn’t act as freely as the third group – I think giving the people a bit more time to get into the mood before starting the mini-classes would also have enriched our lessons. (I’m just guessing around here, it’s just a personal feeling of mine ;) )</div><div><br><br></div><div>- Last but not least as for your idea of A/B teaching: Great idea! It did totally benefit from it. With every group we did it a bit differently and I felt that the third time was our best. (mostly because we talked less and less ;) )</div><div>I was especially happy when 2 or 3 people came to me to ask further questions, like I had suggested they could =)</div><div>We also got some very positive personal feedback, which feels very good =)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>soooo, thank you for a wonderful evening full of new experiences and a lot of fun!!!</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>lena =)</div>
