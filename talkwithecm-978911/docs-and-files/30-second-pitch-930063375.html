      <div>Email<br><br></div><div>A friend of mine landed a great job, without even sending out a job application!</div><div>How did she do it?</div><div>Read my most recent post - Your 30 Second Spotlight to find out.</div><div><br></div><div>I love seeing people succeed. Really. Whether it is a great big public celebration, like watching my home team, the Eagles, win the superbowl, or a small personal victory, like learning to flip eggs in a pan with one hand, success feels great. In the business world, this is true as well.</div><div><br></div><div>The other day I noticed that a friend of mine just got a really great position in a fairly competitive field. Without waiting a second, I called her up to congratulate her. After multiple dead ends and rejections, she finally got exactly what she wanted. I am really happy for her. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Being the curious person that I am, I had to find out - How did she do it?&nbsp;</div><div>What is the key to landing a choice job position?&nbsp;</div><div>Is it using the right online job portal - Monster or LinkedIn?</div><div>What about the cover letter? Is it better to use Arial or Times New Roman?</div><div>Arrhh! Sometimes it is easy to be paralyzed by the maze of mini-decisions.</div><div><br></div><div>Her answer was simple - none of that mattered!</div><div><br></div><div>She knew exactly what she wanted to do and was able to articulate herself clearly and succinctly when it really counted. She had a great 30 second pitch!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Read all about it in my post - Your 30 Second Spotlight</div><div><br><br>POST</div><div>Your 30 Second Spotlight<br><br></div><div>Some people have all the luck, or at least that is the way it seems. A friend of mine landed herself a wonderful job position, one that didn’t even exists before she got it. Seriously - the job did not exist before she got it, they created the position just for her! That sounds like a dream, right? Rather than being stuck with the masses, sending out piles of job applications and going through numerous grueling interviews, she had the company reach out to her and tailor the position to meet her needs. What kind of wizardry is that?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>How did she do it?</div><div><br></div><div>I can tell you, there was no luck or trickery involved, simply good timing. She knew what she wanted to do and was able to articulate herself clearly and succinctly when it really counted. She had a great 30 second pitch!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Sometimes 30 seconds is all you have to deliver your message.</div><div><br><br></div><div>Your 30 Second Pitch<br><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">How to describe yourself professionally<br></span><br></div><div>Most people find it difficult to describe themselves, and yet this skill is often essential for making a good first impression. Whether you are at a networking event, updating your online profile or preparing for a job interview, being able to describe yourself well in a short amount of time can make a huge difference in the way that others perceive you. Many job interview professionals suggest creating your own ‘elevator pitch,’ that is a 30 second speech that highlights the most important details a person needs to know about you and your goals.</div><div><br></div><div>What about you? Can you give a convincing description of yourself in a few sentences? Keep reading to learn how.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Some people might think it is weird to prepare a 30 second introduction in advance. Many people think that the right words will come magically when the time is right. Well, if that works for you, great. But, if you are like me and feel nervous under pressure, taking a few minutes to prepare yourself now will help you make sure that you have exactly the right words you need when pressure is on and what you say matters.</div><div><br></div><div>When presenting yourself professionally, in a job interview, networking event or even on your CV, the right description can really make all the difference. Active verbs and professional adjectives are a great way to start.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h1>Active Verbs</h1><div>Verbs have the ability to describe an action, state or occurrence. Including professional verbs on your CV can instantly change a list of generic job titles into dynamic job skills.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Think about a team leader. In truth, we all know that getting a group of people to work well together takes a lot of skill and effort. Sadly, there is no guarantee that the person reading your CV will automatically associate those great things with you. Rather than take a chance, use verbs to specifically describe what you are able to do. Were you directing and guiding the group? Did did advise and train your team? Use active verbs to specifically describe your skills and talents. Following these examples, change plain job titles into phrases starting with strong verbs:</div><div>Team Lead - Directed and mentored a 5 person team</div><div>Customer Support - Advised clients and resolved issues</div><div>When presenting yourself professionally, choosing to use active verbs helps create a better visual image and emphasizes your unique skills.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h1>Professional Adjectives</h1><div>Adjectives like <em>courteous</em> and <em>honest </em>might sound great on a dating website, or even when meeting new friends, but both descriptions fall a bit flat in a job interview. What does courteous actually mean in the workplace? Where exactly the is the value of telling a potential employer that you are honest? Do the work of connecting the dots for your listener. Try changing simple adjectives directly into job related skills.&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Courteous - I care about the workplace atmosphere.</li><li>Honest - I value integrity.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Translating adjectives into job related skills not only has the potential to grab the attention of your listener, but also helps you stand out from the many other applicants.</div><div><br></div><div>Can you give a convincing description of yourself in a few sentences?&nbsp; What is your 30 second description about yourself?</div><div><br></div><div>Share your answer in the comments below.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">As this is my first post about presenting yourself professionally, please let me know your thoughts. If this topic interests you, please leave me a comment or question below.</span></div><div><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">If you find this article helpful, please share within your community.</span></div><div><br>How to craft a strong 30 second pitch&nbsp;<br>RULE #1 - Quickly define the who, what &amp; how of what you do.&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Who do you help?<ul><li>Do you help busy professionals, single moms or small and medium sized businesses? Try to get a very clear image of who is in your target group. Sharing this information let's people know quickly and clearly who you want to connect with at the event. If the person you are speaking with is in your target group, you will probably instantly catch their attention and spark their interest. Even if they are not in your target group, they might have a close contact who does fit your description and listen in anyway to give a referral. Word of mouth recommendations are always great.</li></ul></li><li>What do you help your clients actually do?<ul><li>Now that you have defined who you help, it is time to think about what you actually help people do. What do you actually offer? How do you add value? Try to step away from bland job titles and straight forward task execution. Think about the solutions you offer to your target audience. Let's take the example of a fitness coach, 'I help busy professionals learn how to properly lift weights.' Although that is true and important, it is not something that most busy professionals have a passion about learning. Paint the picture of the future you can offer. Consider 'I help busy professionals lose weight, feel healthy and get the body they dream of for life.'</li></ul></li><li>How do you actually help others achieve success?&nbsp;<ul><li>This is where you get into the details of how you actually deliver your promised results. At this point you can go into more detail about the programs and services that you actually offer.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><div>RULE #2 - Keep it short and agile&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Start with a quick 10 seconds introduction - Aim for 10 words or less<ul><li>Who are you? - Say your name. 'Hi, I'm Elizabeth.'</li><li>I help (who) do (what) - Give a brief intro to the 'who' and 'what' of your offer<ul><li>I help people relax and remove stress related tension. (Massage Therapist)&nbsp;</li><li>I help busy professionals get fit and feel great without giving up the foods that they love. (Fitness Coach)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>30 second pitch<ul><li>After you have established a connection beyond the initial 10 seconds introduction, it is time to offer more information about how you want to add value for others.</li><li>HOW you do it - add value</li><li>Give context - maybe someone has not heard of your company/school - why is this important</li><li>Make a connection - How is this important to your listener? What do you want your listener to do?</li><li>ASK - for what you want!!! Don't assume that people know.</li><li>Close - thank, be polite, mention your next step</li><li>This is also the part where you want to get permission to go deeper - tease</li><li>Goal - 'Oh, that's interesting, tell me more.'</li></ul></li></ul><div></div>
