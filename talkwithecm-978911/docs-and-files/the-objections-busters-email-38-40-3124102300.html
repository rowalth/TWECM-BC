      <div><strong>Bringing up the objections BEFORE they do -<br>Objections as HARD LESSONS, MISCONCEPTIONS, NO TIME</strong><br><br><em>Note from Raelyn: Here’s the thing. For every product or service that you have, you NEED to know the top 10 objections your potential customers have that stops them from buying. Think: Why will people NOT buy your product?<br></em><br></div><div><em>For instance, someone could think that list building is not needed if they want to start a successful online business. It is your job in this email to convince them that list building is absolutely essential if they want to succeed online.
