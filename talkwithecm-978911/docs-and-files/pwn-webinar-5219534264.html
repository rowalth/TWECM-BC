I have helped 1000's of people do the things they didn't think were within their reach, make key connections to boost their career and become the goto person in their niche, even with a nagging little Nelly inside their own minds telling them they can't. <strong>You know that little voice saying you can't do this, or you shouldn't do this and putting you down?</strong> Well, I show exactly how to turn that around and use it to your advantage. <strong>How cool is that? </strong>It's great &amp; I love what I do, actually I love seeing the results and what people are able to do once they realize how this works. I will share this with you today. <strong>Would you like that?</strong></div><div><br>But first, let's talk about Covid-19 - the pandemic - crisis. Or as I like to call it corona crazy!<br>Like many people, Covid-19 changed my business. Heck, It changed my life. It changed the way I talk to people. Suddenly, all of my off-line tactics - everything my professional career was based on - were in jeopardy, I felt everything I had worked so hard to build up, was slipping away, like sand running through my fingers. I was used to going out, meeting people face to face, networking events, huge gatherings, you know what I mean. And guess how successful I was at getting to events, now that ALL events are canceled??<br><br>&nbsp;Now to help me get a sense of who's here &amp; what you are going through - answer this question: <strong>Which aspects of your life have changed due to the current pandemic? </strong>work / business / family / social life / mental health / everything<br><br>At the start, things did not look good for me. I knew that I had to make a change. I knew that I wanted to get online and fast, but the last videos I made were, well, old and lame.<br>Yeah - here's a photo :)<br>And then that little voice, my inner critic - who is AMAZINGLY GOOD at creating excuses bombarded me with this list:&nbsp;<br>You have -<br>-NO recording studio / team<br>-NO high-end recording gear&nbsp;<br>-NO professional editing software<br>-NO studio lighting<br>-LAME hair / makeup&nbsp;<br>-LAME attractive logo<br>-LAME online presence / personal brand<br>-LAME social media savvy (twitter / instagram / Facebook page &amp; public figure / LinkedIn / etc.)<br><br>So, I decided to do some research &amp; get some tips...well every single article/blog/guide that I read told me this wasn't good enough. I needed better equipment, lighting, logos, editing software...you know the drill, even fake eyelashes. So, yeah. I didn't find the encouraging words I was looking for.&nbsp;<br>BUT&nbsp;<br>in 9 weeks I made 21 fb live videos, 4 webinars, over 30 private lessons &amp; countless online meet ups with friends - on nomi / Sips!&nbsp; - between all other work / toddler life &amp; oh yeah...I had signed up for a German class back in January...which also shifted online<br><br>So, I was a video producing machine....&amp; that felt great...but all I heard was crickets. Wait, I heard an overactive inner critic AND crickets....<br>talk about frustrating... I felt like I was working against all odds to create valuable content...for NOTHING&nbsp;<br><br>So, I reached out to my husband, Roman Walther of Digital Advisory for help.&nbsp;<br>Let me be a bit vulnerable here - when I say reached out, that is the understatement of the year, I was like desperately begging &amp; pleading for help.&nbsp;<br><br>bless his heart, he gave me the exact tips &amp; inspiration I needed to actually get the contact I was producing in front of the exact people who wanted to hear my message. The magic mix - the right content with the right people<br><br>within days- days everything turned around - I expanded my online networking reach to nearly 10,000 people.&nbsp;<br><br>wow!&nbsp;<br>&amp; all of this taught me pretty quickly you don't need professional quality video or stellar lighting&nbsp; to make valuable connections with people through video &amp; that's what I want to share with you.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Let's do this!<br><br><br></div><ul><li>The limitations brought on by this pandemic - how you embrace the struggle and create unique opportunities to your advantage.<ul><li>work is changing / business is changing</li><li>people are home - fewer distractions....(kids / no kids) more time....ON LINE&nbsp;</li><li>shopping / consuming - 59% of people are looking for new solutions / trying new things / new brands -&nbsp;<strong>informal survey - who has tried something new since march?? type NEW, of those, did you spend any money?? PAID</strong></li><li>see how this works? yes, things look like a downturn, but if you look behind the curtain, people ARE getting out there, looking for solutions AND spending money.&nbsp;</li><li>IF you have something to offer, something of real value, which you do, now is the time to get infant of your audience and give them the chance to see &amp; get to know YOU.&nbsp;</li><li>But wait...there is a pandemic, isn't that scammy / sleazy / weird to be promoting &amp; looking for sales now??&nbsp; I am NOT talking about taking advantage of people, or profiting from their loss, I am talking about how to add value and meet the needs of people / companies / employers now, today, when they are desperately looking for solutions - because people ARE buying &amp; business ARE hiring. Besides, if you don't put your offer out now...someone else will.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>#1 struggle holding most professionals back and limiting their career right now - and it’s not what you think!</li></ul><div>.</div><div>3.</div><div>You’ll get access to all the materials you need now to create a live video tonight, including&nbsp;<br><br></div><ul><li>Mindset Detox - Melt away toxic thought patterns &amp; create a clear path to getting the attention you deserve</li><li>Mini-challenges - Simple, fun action steps to conquer your inner critic &amp; turbo-charge your digital presence</li></ul><div><br></div><div><br><br>###################</div><div><br></div><div>​</div><div>Spend the next 5-40 minutes providing real, true value for your listeners.</div><div>Everything they need to know in order to go and implement their learnings and see the same</div><div>success you saw.​)<br>If you have an offer for your listeners, now is the time to prep the audience to hear it. You’veshared a ton of value with your listeners by this point, so now it’s time to tie in your product orservice with the solution you just provided.The offer should be unique (they can’t get it anywhere else) and valuable (you shoulddemonstrate the true value of the offer and the the special price or discount they are getting forit by acting today).Create urgency by adding a countdown to your offer by using a program like ​EverWebinar​.Now it’s time to open up for Q&amp;A.By presenting the offer first and doing the Q&amp;A after, you can answer questions about thepresentation and about the offer.Stay on and answer everyone’s questions until there are none left, no matter how long it takes.Not everyone will take you up on your offer at this moment, but you should follow up with anemail in the next 24-48 hours that includes a recording of the webinar, a reminder about theoffer and a reminder about the benefits of the offer<br><br><br>**************<br><br></div><div>How to get star reviews even if you hate talking to a camera<br><br>How to authentically connect with others without leaving your living room<br>looking good, star reviews<br>looking professional, being judged <br><strong>Mindset detox</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Being judged - going on stage, making a presentation, having a conversation...<br>people are listening and making quick judgements - it is what we do<br>Is this interesting?

I'm talking about that little voice inside your head that says you can't do it, or worse that you shouldn't even try. Why would anyone listen to me? What if I don't have the right credentials? What if they think I'm stupid? Your inner critic can be a good guide to challenge yourself and to make good decisions, but it should not paralyse you or stop you from taking action. Remember that there are a lot of things about you that people can't even see until you show them:<br><br></div><ul><li>Your education/experience</li><li>Your hard work to get where you are today</li><li>Your kind personality</li></ul><div>This webinar is all about setting yourself up with the right foundation - who you are and the value you add.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, that we've talked about how to do it - I have a challenge for you- let's put this into action.<br><br></div><div>Action Step - Do it right now!!!</div><div>Video camera - send it to me</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>What we have done today is only 1 piece of a complete solution</div><div></div>
