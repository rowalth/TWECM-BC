      <div>Hello Islam!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for your question&nbsp;</div><div>It's a really good question and a topic that many people struggle with - conversation topics!</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe you're sitting around the table, waiting for the meeting to start...but you don't know what to talk about.</div><div><br></div><div>Or you join your colleagues for an after work party...but you're not sure how to strike up a conversation outside of work topics.</div><div><br></div><div>Or perhaps small talk is not a problem, but you want to move beyond meaningless chit-chat, connect on a personal level and add real value!</div><div><br></div><div>So, you are looking for advanced topics to start conversations with your colleagues - this is a good question, because you are very specific about the exact context - your colleagues, or people that you see often. But before we start jumping into solutions...I'd want to dig a little deeper, to help get a clearer image of the exact situation. Here are a few questions to help:</div><div><br></div><div>- What are you currently doing to start conversations with your colleagues?&nbsp;</div><div>- How do you feel in that exact moment?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Knowing these answers will help zero in on the best (&amp; most sustainable!) solution for you!</div><div><br></div><div>To get really great conversation topics for a specific group of people, it is important to do a bit of pre-work. That is, a bit a research to set yourself up BEFORE you even start speaking. From your question, I know that you are ready to take that step.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here is a 3 part technique to really listen in an connect with others that I use, my clients are using and I recommend for you:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Listen - Before jumping in and trying to be the center of attention, take some time to sit back and listen. What are people talking about? Which topics are interesting / funny / important to this specific group of people? Pay attention and take notes.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Ask questions - Focus on open ended questions, especially HOW &amp; WHY questions. Ask these questions to pull out the story of others and get them to talk more. A great tip to start is to prepare a few interesting questions in advance.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;3. Experiment - So now that you know topics that this specific group likes to discuss, start talking about it! If you’re in a group of people that loves talking about food - bring up that new restaurant across town, or the Jamie Oliver’s recent tweet about meat free meals!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The most important thing at each step is to pay close attention to how people respond (write it down!), reflect and try again :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;If this topic is interesting for you or you simply want to know more, let me know in the comments below!</div>
