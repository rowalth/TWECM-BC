      <div><br>Empowering professionals to speak out so that they can effortlessly attract attention, wow their audience and totally kick imposter syndrome to the curb!<br><br></div><div><br>Discover your personal communication type based on your strengths, limitations &amp; physiological makeup, and I will show you how to use the power of psychology to turn your strengths into a true superpower!<br><br></div><div><br>WHAT'S YOUR PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION STYLE?<br><br></div><div><br><br><br></div><div>It's time to start that conversation and get the party started!<br><br></div><div><br>With my guidance, my clients know exactly how to cut through marketing jargon, and pack a powerful punch with magnetic confidence, clear verbal branding and strategic networking, because they know exactly what to say and how to say it.<br><br></div><div><br>Interested?<br><br><br>What's a verbal brand and why do you even need one? Most people don't even realize that they have a branding problem until it is too late.<br><br></div><div><br>Verbal branding is all about knowing what to say &amp; how to say it in a way that connects with your audience and is consistant to who you are and what you offer.<br><br></div><div><br>Take this diagnostic quiz and discover for yourself:<br><br></div><div><br>DOES YOUR BRAND PASS THE TEST?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Hi there go-getter!<br><br></div><div><br>If you're here reading this, I guess that you're driven by passion and have big dreams - not the usual oh-hum dreams, but really fantastic, uniquely you dreams!<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You have great ideas, and you are ready to reach out, but it seems like as soon as you say your dream, goal or even fantasy out loud, there is always a pessimistic Patty there to shoot it down. [No offense to anyone named Patty :) ]</div><div>The thought of actually building something up and getting people onboard seems impossible.</div><ul><li>You feel stuck</li><li>Not clear on who you need to talk to</li><li>Not sure how to start the conversation</li><li>No idea what you should even say</li><li>Persuasion is like a foreign language to you</li><li>Moving everything online hasn't helped much either</li></ul><div>When you do start to talk, you hate seeing eyeballs gloss over, people staring blankly like they just don't get it, or care. Sometimes you don't feel like saying anything at all.</div><div>Small talk feels so painful.</div><div>The very idea of reaching out and trying to get others to say yes and support your project, idea or business feels slimy and overwhelming. In weak moments you question if you should even try.</div><div>If you're really honest with yourself, sometimes it feels like you're trapped in a hamster wheel, running as fast as you can, but not really moving forward at all. Deep in your heart, you know that you have real value to offer, but you feel invisible. Maybe you see glimpses of your tired and frustrated face when you look in the mirror, or the dread in the pit of your stomach as you lie awake at night...and, if something doesn't change? How much longer can this go on? How much longer can you keep doing what you've been doing before you reach a breaking point?</div><div>Hi, I'm Elizabeth and I used to have that look in my eyes. I saw my own exhausted face reflected in my daughter's eyes, and I hated it. I knew I had to make a change, for her, for me, for all of us.</div><div>I hated not really being seen or recognized for my hard work, and everything I did felt like an expensive hobby.</div><div>I was sick and tired of watching others succeed while I felt stuck just sitting on the sidelines, waiting and wondering if my turn would ever come.</div><div>So, I decided to jump into game, crack the code of branding and create a new system - one that would set my soul on fire, enable me to authentically reach out to my audience and unlock extraordinary transformations for my clients.</div><div>I made it my mission to break the curse of "not enough," smash the myth of "just work harder," and today I show others how to do the same.</div><div>In fact, over 1000 people have benefited from my trainings and guidance and now feel the freedom of confidently speaking out, making meaningful connections and living life on their own terms.</div><div>If you want to feel that spark of attracting the right kind of attention, impressing your audience and kicking imposter syndrome to the curb - you can get step by step support and start making meaningful connections the easy way.</div><div>Are you ready to come on a journey with me and experience a whole new way to be seen, heard and respected in your field?</div><div>If you can feel your heart flutter at the idea, there are 3 ways we can work together:<br>1. Join me on social<br>2. Take my Verbal Branding Quiz</div><div>3. Book a call to see if my 1:1 guidance is the right path for you.</div><div>Here's to creating meaningful conversations, successful relationships and life that lights you up!<br><br><br><br><br>Extra support for when you need it -<br><br></div><div><br>English for specific purposes / Product Naming / Negotiations / Presentation Skills / Focus on your exact learning goals and get the skills &amp; support you need to succeed.<br><br></div><div><br>&nbsp;<br>Hi, my name is Elizabeth and I am the ecm of talkwithecm. I am the fun brain tickler, challenge maker and joy behind much of what we offer at talkwithecm.</div><div>And, as for why you should listen to me over the countless other voices in the world of business and shameless self-promotion let me give you the short answer (because we are all busy)</div><div><br>I am a conversation advocate - and master of meaningful small talk. I have international communication and business skills up the wazoo from my background in sales, procurement and new business development. Language skills - English, Mandarin, German - (Shhh don't tell Marie Kondo, but I'm the owner of over a 1000 grammar and language books), a graduate of Feng Jia University - yup, an MBA in Chinese! and countless language schools, international negotiation and mediation courses, including hands on practical experience with peace negotiations in N. Ireland, Israel and a few big hairy mergers in the USA. I know the power of authentic connections and relationship building, especially in business. I've further broadened my horizons with community leadership positions, acting, and made some serious cash as a voice recording specialist. Not only am I totally willing to completely suck at something new, but I know the secret code to make impossible dreams - POSSIBLE!<br><br></div><div><br>With all of that experience, the one thing that I noticed again and again is that success, especially in business is directly linked to your ability to connect with others and build relationships, and <strong>the whole purpose of Branding, and even personal branding, is to connect with others, start conversations and build relationships.<br></strong><br></div><div><br>I have worked with thousands of busy professionals and helped them go from feeling intimidated and over looked to being THE sought after expert in their field, who knew exactly what to say and how to say it without stumbling for words, lame scripts or fake smiles. And they rave about the fact that they can now confidently walk into any room, and effortlessly strike up a conversation - even with complete strangers -and easily talk about themselves / their business / their product with clarity and spark the genuine interest of others.<br><br></div><div>The reason I do this work is because I absolutely love it. I love being able to help busy professionals find the right words with the right tone to present themselves with ease and power. I love knowing that they can use their voice, and their own words to establish themselves and completely overcome imposter syndrome. From not being able to explain what they do without watching people's eyes gloss over to knowing exactly when and how to engage and intrigue others with magnetic attraction. It’s like having people fall in love with your most honest YOUNESS. Seriously. FOR EVER.</div><div><br><br></div><div></div>
