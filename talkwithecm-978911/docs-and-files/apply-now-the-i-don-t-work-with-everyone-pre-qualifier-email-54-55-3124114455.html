      <div><em>Note from Raelyn: Use this email to create a sense of exclusivity around what you offer. In this email, you talk about how you don’t work with everyone and that you work tirelessly to pre- qualify and verify that people are suitable for your program before accepting them. You talk about who you are looking for. The idea is to call out people you want to work with to get their attention and interest. Direct them to your Facebook messenger and continue the sales process from there.<br></em><br></div><div><strong><br>Subject Line: I’m looking for a very specific type of person...&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Email Copy:<br></strong>I’m looking for a very specific type of person to work with, [first name].<br><br></div><div>After [#] years of working together with [describe who you are working with, e.g. students / entrepreneurs / marketers / teachers / doctors / etc], I know the kind of person that my experience &amp; skills can best help.<br><br></div><div>And today, I am looking for 5 of these specific people to fill up the last 5 slots in my [coaching program/group coaching program/course/program/etc].<br><br>I am not afraid to turn away people because my programs are usually oversubscribed. Plus, I have found that pre-qualifying people beforehand is the best way to ensure that I get people results - instead of accepting everyone, I look through each student’s profile to make sure that they are suitable for the program FIRST.<br><br></div><div>It’s a win-win because you don’t sign up for a program that can’t help you, and I don’t work with a person that I don’t feel 100% good about.<br><br></div><div><strong>I am looking for someone who is:<br></strong><br></div><div>●&nbsp; [Describe how they are like.
