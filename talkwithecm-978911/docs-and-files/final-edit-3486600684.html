Walking around with another student, they visited booths, picked up brochures from different companies &amp; gathered information about career opportunities. They both had similar interests and skills. At one booth, her friend asked a few questions, shared her CV &amp; left with the business card of the contact person at the company. So they continued until the end of the day, when her friend had a number of contacts. Sue was flabbergasted, how did that happen? <strong>"She got the contact &amp; I have nothing!"<br></strong><br></div><div>Has this ever happened to you? Two people with similar skills and experience, but one gets the job and the other one leaves empty handed. In the story above, it is all about networking - reaching out and making a connection with another person.</div><div>I know you're thinking, "But wait a minute, Elizabeth, she didn't get the <strong>job</strong>, she just got a <strong>contact</strong>. Sue can still send her CV – it's the same."</div><div>Is it? Is tossing your CV into a pile the same as having a direct contact waiting for your CV? Not really.<br><br></div><div><strong>The reality of CV overload:</strong><br>With so many job seekers flooding the market with CVs, employers receive an average of 250 applications per job posting. 250!<br><br></div><div>The hard truth is that most CVs are cut by computer filters before a human eye even sees it. Despite the painstaking hours you put into making your CV perfect, it is only one small piece of what employers want to know - <strong>who are you and how can you bring value to our team?<br></strong><br></div><div>That's the key question - isn't it? Not just for hiring managers or getting a job, but also for making a sales pitch, reaching new clients, opening new markets, negotiating mergers, making friends in a new city - who are you and what value are you bringing into the equation?<br>This is the question you need to answer.&nbsp;</div><div>What are your options?<br><br></div><ul><li>Keep playing the numbers game - it will work, eventually.</li><li>Work with a recruiter or headhunter - but then you'll have to evaluate the cost, considering the limited access to diverse companies and direct competition with other top candidates.</li><li>Start reading the huge pile of books and blogs about how to connect with others.</li><li>Sign up for my course and get game changing results within 30 days <strong>– guaranteed!</strong></li></ul><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Introducing <strong>Start Your Conversation With Success<br></strong><br></div><div>Today I am combining what I've learned into one package – My proven system to get unstuck, overcome your fears &amp; speak confidently in English to communicate beyond your current language level &amp; reach your professional goals.<br><br></div><div><strong>Your ability to connect with people is the single greatest competitive advantage that you can get.<br></strong><br></div><div>Most English classes are about topics:</div><ul><li>phrasal verbs</li><li>how to talk about the weather</li><li>the Emmy awards</li><li>whatever</li></ul><div>and that's good, but most people find it difficult to apply that to a real life situation - a real life situation where what you do really matters: a job interview, a networking event, a hot new happy hour<br><br></div><div>In this course I will show you how to speak and actually change the way that others see you, so they can finally see the real you that is waiting to come out.</div><ul><li><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://i2.wp.com/lp.talkwithecm.com/wp-content/plugins/optimizePressPlugin/lib/assets/images/feature_block/icons/144-alt.png?ssl=1" width="64" height="64"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">
