[No offense to anyone named Patty :) ]</div><div><br>Sometimes just the thought of actually building something up and getting people onboard seems impossible.</div><ul><li>You feel stuck</li><li>Not clear on who you need to talk to</li><li>Not sure how to start the conversation</li><li>No idea what you should even say</li><li>Persuasion is like a foreign language to you</li><li>Moving everything online hasn't helped much either</li></ul><div>When you do start to talk, you hate seeing eyeballs gloss over, people staring blankly like they just don't get it, or they just don't care. Maybe you don't feel like saying anything at all.</div><div>Small talk feels so painful.<br><br></div><div>The very idea of reaching out and trying to get others to say yes and support your project, idea or business feels slimy and overwhelming. In weak moments you question if you should even try.<br><br></div><div>If you're really honest with yourself, sometimes it feels like you're trapped in a hamster wheel, running as fast as you can, but not really moving forward at all. Deep in your heart, you know that you have real value to offer, but you feel invisible. Maybe you see glimpses of your tired and frustrated face when you look in the mirror, or the dread in the pit of your stomach as you lie awake at night...and, if something doesn't change?&nbsp;<br>How much longer can this go on?&nbsp;<br>How much longer can you keep doing what you've been doing before you reach a breaking point?<br><br></div><div>Hi, I'm Elizabeth and I used to have that look in my eyes. I saw my own exhausted face reflected in my daughter's eyes, and I hated it. I knew I had to make a change, for her, for me, for all of us.<br><br></div><div>I hated not really being seen or recognized for my hard work, and everything I did felt like an expensive hobby.<br><br></div><div>I was sick and tired of watching others succeed while I felt stuck just sitting on the sidelines, waiting and wondering if my turn would ever come.<br><br></div><div>So, I decided to change the game, crack the code of branding and create a new system - one that would set my soul on fire, enable me to authentically reach out to my audience and unlock extraordinary transformations for my clients.<br><br></div><div>I made it my mission to break the curse of "not enough," smash the myth of "just work harder," and today I show others how to do the same.<br><br></div><div>In fact, I've seen the dramatic changes my trainings and guidance have given others, giving them the key to speak out with confidence and finally be seen and recognized for who they really are. They share their stories with me about how they now feel the freedom of confidently speaking out, making meaningful connections and living life on their own terms.<br><br></div><div>If you want to feel that spark of attracting the right kind of attention, impressing your audience and kicking imposter syndrome to the curb - you can get step by step support and start making meaningful connections the easy way.</div><div>Are you ready to come on a journey with me and experience a whole new way to be seen, heard and respected in your field?<br><br></div><div>If you can feel your heart flutter at the idea, there are 3 ways you can work with me:<br>1. Join me on social<br>2. Take my Verbal Branding Quiz</div><div>3. Book a call to see if my 1:1 guidance is the right path for you.</div><div>Here's to creating meaningful conversations, successful relationships and life that lights you up!</div>
