I really do. I love helping people find ways to achieve their goals and reach success. I also love when people share their experiences with me. I enjoy connecting with learners so we can celebrate successes and work together to find realistic solutions to overcome the struggles they have.</div><div><br></div><div>Last week, I listened to some English learners discuss their future plans and Dream Job. I found their answers fascinating. Each person said something that we can use to help improve our own speaking skills.

I mean, like a question that we should know the answer to but, because of stress or getting caught unprepared, suddenly the only thing we can do it blink and smile. I remember one such instance when I was caught off-guard, I was totally stunned. I sort of panicked and lost all of my words. It felt like my stomach dropped to the floor and all I could do was open &amp; close my mouth like a goldfish - no words would come out!<br><br>Any number of questions can be difficult to answer, especially when using another language to answer them. Today I want share a story about two people I overheard while sitting in a local coffee house. Like me, they flipped and flopped around like a goldfish out of water, unable to really answer the simple question: What is your dream job?<br>'Uhhh....well...'<br>'I suppose...?'<br><br>Whether you want to be a HR specialist or a online life coach, it is important to be able to communicate your wants and desires to others around you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><ul><li>What are you doing now?</li><li>Do you like what you do?</li><li>What do you want to do in the future?</li><li>What is your dream job?</li></ul><div><br>Knowing how to communicate your wants and desires to others on demand can be the difference between staring like a stunned goldfish or landing your dream job. When the right moment comes along, you want to be able to clearly articulate your aim without stumbling around searching for an idea.<br><br>Keep reading to learn more.<br><br>Last week, while sitting in a local coffee shop sipping on my nice foamy cafe latte, I overheard some people practicing English together. I couldn’t believe my luck! There I was sitting and thinking about helping people gain confidence while speaking English while they were actually working on that right there in front of me. Fantastic! I couldn’t help but listen.<br><br>As each person took a turn asking and answering the questions above, I noticed that for the first two questions everything went as expected. In general, people are fairly good at explaining what they do as well as talking about likes and dislikes.&nbsp;</div><ul><li>I like working in an office.

Looking for something better?</div><div>Great.</div><div>That’s step one, knowing that you want a change.&nbsp;</div><div>The next step is deciding what you want.</div><div>What is your dream job?</div><div><br></div><div>One thing that I really enjoy about my job is that I can work from anywhere - literally anywhere! I made my first online session in the comfort of my bedroom. Another time I did some work while on ‘vacation’ in Switzerland. But usually, I work from home and on occasion from a local coffee shop called, ‘Budapest.’ Fancy name, right?</div><div><br></div><div>Last week, while sipping on a nice foamy cafe latte, I overheard some people practicing English together. I couldn’t believe my luck! There I was sitting and thinking about helping people gain confidence while speaking English while they were actually working on that right there in front of me.

No one appreciates my work, etc.</li></ul><div>____________________<br>____________________</div><div>Things changed a lot for the last question. Their entire flow of conversation basically fell apart. Over the years, I have noticed that this is where most people struggle. What about the future? What is it that you want to do? What is your dream job? In this case, the answers given were totally unclear. Neither person could really give an answer about future plans, and no real answer about a dream job.</div><ul><li>I don’t know. I’d like to travel more?</li><li>Maybe I will get an MBA...</li></ul><div>So more travel and more schooling? Sounds great, but then what? Neither of these activities will put cash into your bank account any time soon, and no one answered the most interesting question:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What is your dream job?</div><div><br></div><div>To be fair, the answers above can help shed some light onto future career options. We all know that there are some really great bloggers who make money while traveling the globe, and getting an MBA will certainly help put you on the path to a better paid position, but without a clear idea of what you want to do, how can you be sure that an MBA will help?</div><div><br></div><div>Here are some answers from people who already know what their dream job looks like:</div><ul><li>I want to write city reviews for digital nomads.</li><li>I want to be a software developer for the United Nations.&nbsp;</li><li>I want to focus on luxury real estate &amp; properties management.</li><li>I want to start my own online business as a life coach.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Here are some clips from a video session I made with the theme DREAM JOB &amp; OCCUPATIONS:</div><div><br></div><div>TK - video 1</div><div><br></div><div>What is your dream job?</div><div>What do you want to do in the future?</div><div>Can you say that? Seriously, can you answer the question?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Whether you want to be a famous singer or a shop clerk, it is important to be able to communicate your wants and desires to others around you.
