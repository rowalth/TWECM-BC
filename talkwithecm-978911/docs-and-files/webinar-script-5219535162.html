It's really a no-brainer - do it!<br><br>My question for you tonight is - WHY are you doing what you do?&nbsp;<br>Gives you clarity &amp; your source of Motivation, focus &amp; perseverance<br><br>Rather than getting bogged down with the demands &amp; tasks of life, it is crucial to zero in on your big why, why are you here? Why are you doing this? I can tell you it’s NOT the money. Without even knowing a person, I can tell you that’s never the why. That will just fizzle out quickly. I’ve seen in my own life that once I can get crystal clear about my why, the&nbsp; energy, the motivation, the resources fall into place, that’s all just details - everything comes together. Without asking directly, after hearing the stories &amp; accomplishments of our guest speakers today, I am willing to bet crazy amounts of money that they are totally clear about their big why - their focal point in life.&nbsp;<br><br>Another key question that helps me get to my BIG WHY - What’s in it for you &amp; your family? What are the Benefits?&nbsp;<br>-&gt; Try to complete this sentence: I'm doing this because... I'm so glad that I started this group / volunteering / getting my certification / doing whatever it is your are thinking about taking on... a year ago because...<br>&amp; if the answers aren't inspiring,&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;<br>Once you have this - Communicate this to others - your partner / you children / professionals connections<br><br>Let me ask you right now - <strong>WHY are you doing what you do? What is your BIG WHY? </strong>I'll give you 10 seconds.&nbsp;<br><br>read answers&nbsp;</div><ul><li><strong>What are your big takeaways - what did you hear that you don't want to forget?</strong></li></ul><div><strong>Q&amp;A<br></strong>(5-7 minutes)<br><br></div><ul><li>How to keep children busy on their own using no screens and engaging motor skills in the 3-6 year old range?</li><li>How to speak and explain the situation to children when you're also worried and stressed as a parent?</li></ul><div><br><br><strong>Closing notes, Thank you &amp; goodbye<br></strong><br></div><ol><li>Reminder of VFN Professionals Sips</li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/vienna-family-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/company/vienna-family-network</a> - Charity of the Year: VFN will donate to KiB 50cents per follower of our LinkedIn page.</li><li>Dilek - one of our Speakers in April - would like to share a few words about an upcoming offer.&nbsp;</li></ol><div><strong>THANK YOUS</strong></div><ul><li>Guest Speakers - Katherine &amp; Lisa Kathleen</li><li>VFN</li><li>VFN Professionals Team</li><li>talkwithecm &amp; digital advisory - you might have seen those names lurking around - we are volunteering our professional platforms to support &amp; make all of this possible</li><li>Most of all, we want to thank YOU for being here, participating, interacting, bringing your questions and being the amazing parent you are &amp; for supporting your family throughout this pandemic.
