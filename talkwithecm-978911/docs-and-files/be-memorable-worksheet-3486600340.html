      <ul><li>&nbsp;If you want to learn how to make sense of people's body language, facial expressions and communication styles without letting on that you're watching,&nbsp;</li><li>Being observant takes practice, and it starts with the ability to slow down, stop, and watch. You can't do that if you're always in a hurry, and trying it once or twice won't cut it, either. You can practice being more observant by slowing down in any given situation and taking time to 'smell the roses,' so to speak.</li></ul><div><strong>Get out of your head.</strong> Being constantly preoccupied with your own thoughts, desires, insecurities and so on is a distraction from observing other people. For the sake of being more observant, put your own needs aside and concentrate on the other person. This takes practice, since thought patterns are actually habits that aren't easily changed. Be more aware of where your thoughts are leading, and consciously focus on other people so you can observe them.</div><ul><li>If you walk into a party and are immediately concerned with finding the coolest person to talk to, getting to the bar ASAP or finding the closest exit, you're not giving your brain the space to observe people. Take a step back and let yourself focus on other people (you'll have a better time that way, too).</li><li>When you're talking to someone face to face and you're worried about whether your lipstick's on straight and how your laugh sounds, you aren't being observant. Don't worry about yourself; focus on the other person - you'll learn a lot more that way.</li></ul><div>&nbsp;Body language is incredibly revealing. People often say one thing, but their body language tells a totally different story. Look at the positioning of people's head, arms, hands, back, legs and feet. What can you learn from the language of a person's body?</div><ul><li>If someone says "yes" while shaking his or her head, that can indicate the answer is actually "no."</li><li>If someone refuses to make eye contact, they're probably uncomfortable. (It's a common misconception that lack of eye contact is an <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-With-a-Liar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">indication of lying</a>; actually, the opposite is true.)</li><li>If someone leans back or away while talking, that can indicate the person is stressed out or afraid.</li><li>If someone crosses his or her arms, that usually means he or she is feeling uncomfortable with a situation.</li><li>If someone's hunched over or has bad posture, a confidence issue might be the reason.</li><li>If someone taps his or her feet, anxiety or impatience might be at play.</li><li>If a woman touches her throat, she might be feeling vulnerable.<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Observe-People#_note-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[1]</a></li><li>If a man strokes his chin, he might be feeling anxious.<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Observe-People#_note-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[2]</a></li><li>If you find that you have a lot of room for improvement in this area, practice focusing on defining people's emotions. For example, when someone smiles, don't automatically assume "happy." Look for subtleties that can help you find the deeper, truer emotion. Is the person smiling with his or her entire face (including the eyes) or just the mouth? The former might be an indicator of elation, while the latter might be an indicator of mild amusement.</li></ul><div><strong><br>Listen carefully.</strong> The way a person speaks is another big indication of how he or she is feeling. The pace, volume, and pitch of speech are all important factors. Notice whether the person you're observing is speaking quickly or slowly, higher or lower than normal, and whether their voice is loud or soft.</div><ul><li>People who whisper or speak quietly may be shy or have low confidence.</li><li>Nervousness is often expressed through faster speech.</li><li>People tend to speak at a slightly higher pitch than normal when they're lying.</li><li>When people want to assert dominance, they speak at a slightly lower register.</li></ul><div><strong>Practice speaking more professionally.</strong> Pay attention to your speech habits and patterns and try to adjust them if they aren’t assertive. Avoid using casual, unprofessional words, such as “yup,” “literally,” or “like.” You may find that you talk too fast or speak with a rising tone of voice because you aren’t sure if others will listen to you or you aren’t sure if what you’re saying is right. These habits are inconsistent with assertiveness as they communicate uncertainty and insecurity. Work on changing them in order to be a more assertive communicator.<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Communicate-in-an-Assertive-Manner#_note-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[5]</a><br><br><strong>Use proper body language.</strong> Assertive communication isn’t just verbal. Make sure your body language is strong, confident, and relaxed. This includes making eye contact with others when they speak, and keeping an upright posture.<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Communicate-in-an-Assertive-Manner#_note-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[6]</a></div><ul><li>Eye contact is important, but try not to stare. Blinking and glancing elsewhere are natural. Staring at someone, on the other hand, may come off as aggressive or intimidating.</li><li>For your posture, keep your back upright and your shoulders held back slightly. You should not be tense, but you should be mindful of your body and its composure.</li><li>Try not to close yourself off. Keep your arms and legs uncrossed, and keep your face from furrowing or scrunching as much as you can.</li><li>Be aware of muscle tension in your body. Stretch slightly or take deep breaths to relax your muscles.</li><li><br></li><li><strong>Decide the parameters of your people watching - It helps to know why you're watching.</strong> There can be a number of reasons but the main impetus is observation of how other people live and behave under different circumstances. And watching people is not about feeling superior to others or judging them; more than anything, you're a non-judgmental observer with a penchant for unearthing life's stories as an art of love and empathy. Some reasons for people watching include:It's informative. If you're writing a book or developing characters for a play, observing people can be an excellent way to find traits and styles for your characters. In addition, if you're an actor, observing other people is a window to other ways of standing, walking, talking, and interacting in a natural environment. And it's a great opportunity to test your learning or theories about body language.</li><li><br></li><li>Find a person who grabs your attention&nbsp;</li><li>Ask yourself questions about each person you choose: Why are they here? Are they happy? Nervous? Irritable? Why? What does the way they hold themselves say about them? What about the way they talk? Does it match up?</li><li>From their style and mannerisms, what do you think this person's aspirations, politics, or job would be?</li></ul><div><strong><br>People watch with a pal.</strong> It can be twice the fun to people watch with a friend who is attuned to the art of people watching. Ask one another the questions outlined in the step above. You can even dispute each other's findings until you reach a shared conclusion that pleases both of you! Being able to share your thoughts on people watching can be both a fun and deeply connecting friendship ritual.<br><br>recording your thoughts about the people you've observed, <br><br><strong><br>Watch with good intent.</strong> So that you don't come across as a voyeur or nosy body, be conscious of other people's need for privacy, space, and respect people at all times. Realize that you too are likely the subject of observation now and then, perhaps even as you're people watching one fine afternoon...<br><br><strong>Know how to react if the observed observes back.</strong> Sometimes you will get caught observing and it will be considered staring. There are a number of ways to respond:</div><ul><li>Simply smile, shrug, and look away.</li><li>Engage them in conversation if close enough, and explain what was so engaging or beautiful about them that made you look again.</li><li>Just look down and don't look up again until they've gone. For when you're feeling a little sheepish or afraid!</li><li>Physically turn away or get up and go if things seem uncomfortable.</li><li>&nbsp;If someone gets angry at you, just apologize.</li></ul><div>Not at all! Stalking is a determination to follow a chosen target relentlessly, following them and being wherever they go. People watching is about being observant and carefully viewing a wide range of people wherever you happen to be. You won't know the people you're observing generally, you probably won't ever see most of them again, and even if you do know them, you aren't setting up a pattern of constantly following and harassing them. Totally not the same thing.</div>
