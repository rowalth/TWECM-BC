Despite all this, in 1914, Chaplin managed to get the lead in a film short called Making a Living. <br><strong>To play this role, he chose to dress, act &amp; walk in a very peculiar fashion...it was as if a whole new character had come to life. The rest is history.</strong><br>What instantly set Chaplin apart from the horde of other comedians working in silent film, was this one secret that most gurus just ignore.<br><strong>He used a very specific form of persuasion that gets you money, fame, status and the freedom to do whatever the fark you want.</strong><br>And when you use it well, you’ll target the burning hot take-my-money button in your audiences.&nbsp;<br>It will trigger a deep-seated buying emotion that will make saying “yes” to your offer a no-brainer.<br>It’ll create a buying decision in their minds so one-sided, they’ll either take action or actually apologize for not doing the right thing.&nbsp;</div><div>And yet, this persuasion tactic is so subtle that your audiences will get the point on their own.<br><strong>They’ll decide on their own that what you have is exactly what they want. </strong><br>Using this kind of “sneaky” technique in the right spot, your offer will be near impossible to refuse.</div><div><strong>THE MASTER PERSUADER SECRET #4<br>Evoke a State of Waking Hypnosis Every time You Open Your Mouth</strong></div><div>In 1956 an anonymous hypnotist, in his course, Dynamic Speed Hypnosis, declared:&nbsp;<br>“Anything you do which makes your listeners react because of MENTAL IMAGES you plant in their minds is WAKING HYPNOSIS</div><div>The fastest way to evoke waking hypnosis is to bring enthusiasm into your mannerism. Enthusiasm is contagious and it's also a bit puzzling for some.<br><em>“What is she so enthusiastic about?”<br>“There has to be a reason why she is so excited”</em></div><div><br></div><div>A line delivered with enthusiasm packs a punch so powerful, it’s virtually impossible to escape its magic.</div><div><strong>Do this exercise if you don't believe me:</strong><br>Say this line in a monotone slow unenergetic tone<br><em>“I’m spending summers in a country cottage”<br></em>Now say the exact same thing in an excited happy enthusiastic tone<br><br>Immediately the mental image of that country cottage changes from an old broken down sad looking depilated cottage to a lively fairy house surrounded by ferns with a cute little bench and maybe even a small stream running next to it.<br><br><strong>Enthusiasm sells people. And you cannot persuade anyone of anything unless you yourself are first convinced. </strong><br>Emotional appeal and all the other tips will fall in line if you are sold on what you are saying.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The power of my enthusiasm for my own material is so strong that every time we open a cart for something, we have to email our finance guy to remind him:<br><strong><em>“Just make sure no one buys the same thing twice..or thrice”</em></strong></div><div>Because #truetory we had someone (more than once) buy a $2,500 course THREE TIMES.</div><div>Best part? We are the one who caught this mistake and the pain of having to refund the $5000 is still fresh in my memory. Yes, we told her about the mistake &amp; refunded the money because #integrity</div><div>This Is What A State Of Waking Hypnosis Does To People’s Brains...It’s Almost Automatic And Even Pleasurable. Look At The Video Below From My <strong>Teachable Account Showing Sales From&nbsp; A SINGLE DAY</strong><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://thepersuasionschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ezgif-6-dfe2cd427162.gif" width="960" height="538"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

Don’t WORK Your Way to the Top</div><div>In Winning Through Intimidation, habits expert Robert J. Ringer explores an idea he calls “The Leapfrog Theory.”<br>To give you the (unauthorized) CliffsNotes® version of the theory, Robert basically states that if you want to reach the top tier of your industry, you can either work your way there or you can leapfrog to the top.<br>It takes balls to do it, but people leapfrog with success all the time now. If you're that stylist for entrepreneurs, slap the title right onto your LinkedIn profile — “The Go-To Celebrity Stylist for Online Entrepreneurs.”<br>This is not a get-rich-quick or get-famous-quick scheme. If you call yourself “The Millionaire Mentor” but your business is 3 days old and your net worth has a minus sign in front of it, people will see through your glossy bullshit very quickly.<br>If you claim you've accomplished something when you have not, that is fraud. Plain and simple. How often do we see these “Course Creation Experts” come along but their only credential is buying someone else's course about...you guessed it, creating courses?<br>But if you are the real deal — and because you're reading this, I assume you are — be immodest when business calls for it.</div><div>This is the biggie. The “nuclear” persuasion secret. The mother of all neuro secrets.&nbsp;<br>Get this right and you’ll erase the competition from your audience’s mind, forever.&nbsp;<br>Every marketing piece you create, every email you write, and every video you shoot will be like a black hole, drawing your audience in, ready for whatever you have to offer.</div><div>BUT… get it right and your audiences will be powerless to ignore your message.&nbsp;<br>Using it will stop casual browsers in their tracks and draw them into your story so fully that all other distractions will be shut out and you will hold their attention like a vice.&nbsp;<br>It’ll turn “umm maybes” into “OMG yes yes yes!” and lets you build an army of die hard customers.&nbsp;<br>THAT’S how powerful it is.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>MEET BUSHRA AZHAR // Founder &amp; Lead Trainer Of The Persuasion School</div><div>I am Bushra &amp; I am a mad scientist when it comes to persuasion; reading, testing, researching, mixing up strange unmentionable concoctions and then synthesizing all of this persuasion wisdom into simple actionable strategies that can take you light years ahead of everyone in your industry,<br><strong>I am a self-made multimillionaire, a best-selling author on sales &amp; consumer behaviour and have taught thousands of tiny businesses how to make big bucks using the Psychology of Persuasion.</strong><br>I am legit obsessed with how the human brain works but also with how to use this information to get a YES online.
