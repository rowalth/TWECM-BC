      <h1>How to introduce yourself?</h1><div><br><strong>Share</strong></div><div><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAQCb_8B6z7hjSAA94ULcruYBidSbuVT4HY/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">By Dipal D., Editor at LinkedIn News</a></div><div>Updated 3 days ago</div><div><br><br></div><div>The first question you encounter during an interview, and often after starting a new job, is, “Tell us about yourself.” Self-introduction can look like an easy feat but in that moment, it can leave you confused and tongue-tied. Writing for <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/08/a-simple-way-to-introduce-yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Harvard Business Review</a>, communication coach Andrea Wojnicki outlines the following simple framework to help you structure your response:</div><div>&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Start with your name and the present. You can include details like your geographical location, your current or previously held title, and recent projects.</li><li>Next, give your past background including education, previous employers and roles, projects, and accomplishments.</li><li>End it with your future goals and things you look forward to.</li></ul><div><br><br></div><div><br></div><div>Interesting and valid questions during interviews process and what response the interviewer expects from the candidate. <br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=interviewtips&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6961181108063404032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">#interviewtips</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=opportunityseeker&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6961181108063404032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">#opportunityseeker</a>&nbsp;<br><br>-Question: “Tell us something about yourself.”<br>This isn’t an invitation to recite your resume. It’s a test of whether you can provide a concise, thoughtful overview of your past, present and future. Focus on key decisions and insights that may not show up in your profile.<br>-Question: “Why this organization.”<br>A generic answer can derail your process. Do your research. Write down couple of unique points about the organization that appeal to you. You won’t get the job with your answer, but you can lose because of it.<br>-Question: “What would you do in the first 100 days on the job.”<br>This is the test of your preparation, research, initiative, and humility. Have a concrete plan for how you would approach your early days. Be sure fact finding and learning is a key part of it.<br>-Question: “What are your strengths.”<br>Resist the urge to reel off a long list of broad strengths. Tailor your response to the role and the organization. Provide couple of strengths to make you suited for the job. Leverage storytelling by bringing them to life by anecdotes.<br>-Question: “What are your weakness.”<br>The majority of candidates try to pitch a weakness that is subtly a strength. You should not be doing this. Give a real weakness, but also how you are working to address it.<br>-Question: “Tell me about a time you failed.”<br>This is an assessment of (a) whether you have faced failure (b) your resilience (c) how you grew through the experience. You should have couple of specific stories to share. Be clear as possible by focusing on learning from the failure.<br>-Question: “What questions do you have for me?”<br>This is a test of preparation and personality. Generic questions won’t kill you but won’t help you either. Ask the panel something unique and get them talking.<br>-Question: “Where do you see yourself in next 5 years?”<br>This is an assessment of (a) your ambition (b) whether it aligns with your growth opportunity with the company. Keep these two factors in mind while answering this question.<br>-Question: “Why are you leaving your current job?”<br>This can be a test for negativity. Never say anything negative about your current employer. Stay positive and highlight why the new role is better fit for your goals.<br>The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is mere tenacity.</div><div></div>
