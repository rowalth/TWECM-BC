I tend to remember the incidents in which I have not done my best more than those times I have done my best.<br>8. I rarely do a project or task as well as I’d like to do it.<br>9.

If I’m going to receive a promotion or gain recognition of some kind, I hesitate to tell others until it is an accomplished fact.<br>20.
