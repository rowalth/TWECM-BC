      <div><strong>Day 1 Challenge:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Build bigger mice, not a better mousetrap</div><div><br></div><div>They need to understand what happens if they DON’T solve the problem: magnify the fear, pinpoint</div><div><br></div><div>Solve a very clear, BURNING point - need to spend more time increasing the pain</div><div><br></div><div>Show them what a mice-less world would look like - tell them they DESERVE this existence and only we can get them there</div><div><br></div><div>The offer is what makes people say yes : they are not buying the product, they are buying peace of mind</div><div><br></div><div>7 Offer Angles</div><div>(Segment the audience for each of these)</div><div>1. **Rescue Offer (audience is in a really shitty place: I am going to give you a plan and the tools and pull you out)</div><div>2. **The undiscovered gold offer (possibility of something even better and guide them towards a treasure map/eventual dream - I have a way, I have a system - you don’t know it, but it’s there, I’ll take you there)</div><div>3. Co-Creation Offer (let us hold you by the hand as you do it rather than let me show you step by step)</div><div>4. Hungry Caterpillar - create hunger for the rest by a piece for free (if the free content is this good, how good is the paid? - what they’ve seen means they cannot cancel their membership! )</div><div>5. Let me prove it (do it live and watch people see that it works - no competition here: we are going to do it: case study)</div><div>6. Yay without the boo - create a minor annoyance and the offer</div><div>7. Market disruption offer - unheard of in your industry</div><div><br></div><div>1. Lock the right delivery mechanism</div><div>2. Enhance perceived value of offer</div><div>3. use the right PITCH</div><div>4. use the right Buyer Qualifier</div><div><br></div><div>Include this:</div><div>*the outcome they crave</div><div>*the outcome they want to avoid</div><div>*what is their before state</div><div>*what is their after state</div><div>*what is the minimum time frame</div><div>*what are the mental blocks that stops them from investing</div><div>*what is the benefit apart from competition</div><div><br></div><div>Tell them who it is NOT for</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Day 2 Challenge:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Do I believe my offers are life-changing? How can we make this even better and something we want to join and feel excited about and is truly life-changing?</div><div><br></div><div><em>It is my responsibility to give someone this amazing, life-changing, awesome content.</em></div><div><br></div><div>Rules of endless eyeballs:</div><div>1. Be obsessed with you - your offer, solution, sorry, your signature, your understanding (Be OBSESSED and contagious with YOUR offer - fireworks coming out and you are super excited)</div><div>2. Seek to understand: people don’t buy from people who THEY understand; people buy from people who make them FEEL understood : “You Get Me”; don’t be like understand my offer, me, the sale - you need to understand THEM; how do you get people to look at you and be like “You Get Me”</div><div>3. Be shameless - be relentless, shameless, and proud (you’re not ready to sell a crap ton if you are not shameless)</div><div><br></div><div>Think like the fish, not the fisherman - it won’t sell because YOU relate to it.</div><div><br></div><div>Places to Find EyeballsL</div><div><br></div><div>1. Your own social media (IG, LinkedIn, FB)</div><div>2. Other’s social media (Fb groups, IG, etc., Clubhouse)</div><div>3. Guest blogging (Try this! - pitch it to places and publish; establish authority)</div><div>4. Giveaways/contests</div><div>5. Podcasts</div><div>6. Joint ventures (collaborating with others at the same level)</div><div>7. Sponsored posts/shout outs (Instead of spending ads only - IG posts; ex: womenceo IG, etc.)</div><div>8. Affiliate traffic (commission/cross-promotion)</div><div>9. Customized content w/sale split (serving same audience but offer is different: create it just for the group + exclusive; and other way: if your audience needs something that you don’t sell: have someone else bring it in)</div><div><br></div><div>Hook the Eyeballs:</div><div><br></div><div><em>Attention is the currency of the internet</em></div><div><br></div><div>1. Unique signature system (have a branded framework: our 4 step training)</div><div>2. Borrowed authority (featured in this/worked in this)</div><div>3. Social proof (testimonials/quotes in ads + customers’ video ads)</div><div>4. Own authority (people you’ve helped/money you’ve made; podcast)</div><div>5. A big secret revealed</div><div>6. Diagnostic assessment (identify the problem for someone - a quiz or something; people believe something is wrong and want to know what it is)</div><div>7. Hand on pulse (metrics, industry, etc. - be the first one talking about news)</div><div>8. Disruption</div><div>Campaigns to Use in These Places:</div><div><em>*The PDF has the notes so I only took a few extra ones</em></div><div>1. Do free calls and tease unique signature system (sign up and see how this framework applies to your business idea): a framework shows authority; 1:1 calls; DON’T do CTA on other people’s groups (just be like I’m thinking of…)</div><div>2. DON’T CALL it a free call/discovery call: call it a diagnostic assessment (have them take a quiz) : call it a breakthrough/action plan call</div><div>**100 People E-Book Opt-In (Podcast Round-Up E-Book: People love being people in E-Books and ask them to share it with their audience)</div>
