      The Last Call Email (Price Increasing): Sales Email #5

      <div><em>Note from Raelyn: Make sure to send a last call email about 6 hours before the cart closes, because there will be many people who were previously on the fence OR who wanted to purchase your course, but forgot about it because life got in the way. This email gives them the last reminder that they need. The second last call deadline email scoops up a huge percentage of your customers... so make sure you send this!<br></em><br></div><div><em><br>This last call email is more direct and shorter in length. It merely serves as a reminder and is directed to people on the fence (and people who were seriously considering buying but forgot about your product / service) - forcing people to take action before the deadline ends.<br></em><br></div><div><strong><br>Subject: Price of [Course Name] increases in just 6 hours!<br></strong><br></div><div><strong>Email Copy:</strong></div><div><br>Hey [first name],<br><br></div><div>Are you still confused when it comes to [topic]? [Kick off the email with a question to get their attention]<br><br></div><div>[#] years ago, I never would have thought that... [where you are today].<br>Just imagine where you would be [#] days from now if you start today!<br>As you have probably heard, the [special price / early bird price] for [Course Name] is ending in<br>just 6 hours.<br>[Insert Timer Here]<br>If you want to [end goal], <em>now's </em>the time to do it. [the emphasis on the NOW forces them to take action now.]<br>Enroll in [Course Name] before the price increases within the next [#] hours and save $[#]! <strong>You have two options now:<br></strong>Option #1 (This is the not-so-good one):<br>You can sit there scrolling through this email, wanting to believe but being haunted by fears and past experiences. Wanting to take action but being plagued by self-doubt...as time passes you by.<br>(Honestly, are you prepared to spend years struggling to [end goal]?)<br>Or...<br>Option #2 (This is the REALLY smart one):<br>You can choose to say YES to change in your life and take a step forward to [end goal]. You can choose to say YES to getting dedicated help to finally [end goal].<br><strong>I know what it feels like to [how they are feeling right now].<br></strong>I have specially created [Course Name] for new [how you address your target customers] like<br>yourself who need help with [course topic].<br>[Course Name] features the exact tried-and-tested system that I have used with countless [whoever you have helped - e.g. 1:1 private clients, previous course students, yourself] to [end goal].<br>Once again, in 6 hours, the price of [Course Name] will increase by $[#]. Don’t miss out! <strong>Check out [Course Name] and save $[#] if you enroll within the next 6 hours.</strong><br>See you on the other side!<br>Cheers,<br>[Raelyn - add your name here] [raelyntan.com - add your URL here]</div>
