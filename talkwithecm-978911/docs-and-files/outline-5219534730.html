      <blockquote><strong>The 3 Things You Need To Know To Introduce Yourself WITHOUT Feeling Awkward</strong></blockquote><div>Welcome!<br><br>1 - input - some solo work &amp; writing<br>2 - workshop - physically moving around / talking<br>3 - big reflection &amp; look at next steps<br><br>Whether you are looking for a job, want to grow your business or are looking to push your career to the next level, you know that making a good impression is vital. But, like most people, you may still be unclear or even hesitant about what it really means. This workshop will help you zero in on the essential elements of reaching out, connecting with others and networking to get the results you want. <br><br>Besides being the founder of VFN Professionals, <strong>Elizabeth C. Miller</strong> is a conversation advocate and empowers professionals to use English more confidently and expand opportunities for work, networking &amp; more. With her guidance, her clients have been able to get unstuck and dramatically improve their English skills and reach their goals. Today, she is ready to help you unlock doors and expand your reach – this could mean:<br><br></div><ul><li>taking your networking to the next level</li><li>increasing your salary</li><li>opening new business markets</li><li>securing a new job</li><li>passing an important exam</li><li>developing new business opportunities</li><li>&amp; more!</li></ul><div>1. be approachable<br>- with poll question - who would you approach? photo a,b,c (tight jaw, funky tie/shoes, using phone)<br>2. start simple<br>- what's the best way to start a conversation? with your name / handshake, eye contact, joke, smile, the reason you want to talk to the person<br>3. pay attention to body language<br>who looks more engaged? photo a,b,c (head tilt, leaning in, hand touch, gaze afar)<br><br><br>Now that you have a clearer idea about how to set yourself up for a great introduction, now it is time to put all of this into practice. Or more specifically, how to answer that dreaded question, <strong>"So, tell me, what do you do?" <br></strong><br><strong><br><br>My Super Savvy Introduction&nbsp;<br>I - solo work - WORKSHEET</strong></div><div><br>1) I'm a _______________ (what you do /job title or general description)<br>work with some ideas here - deli-lama!<br><br></div><ol><li>Master of Disaster - helps federal, state, and local authorities access the information they need to recover quickly from calamities - MapInfo Corp.</li><li>President and TeaEO - play on words here for the CEO - Honest Tea</li></ol><div>special note - in between jobs / career shift! add here<br><br>2) and I work with____________________________(who you support /boss, customers)&nbsp;<br>this may seem like a simple question, but take some time to consider ALL of the people that you interact with and how you support them / make their lives better<br><br><br>3) helping them_________________________________(the big picture of what you do)&nbsp;<br><br>4) so that they can __________________________(the results you make possible)&nbsp;<br>this is extremely important - not only do you want to tell what you do, but this makes it crystal clear to your listener WHY your work is important. Ex - I help people lose weight...meh, I help people finally lose the weight they've been carrying around for years so that they can look and feel their best! - do you hear the difference? look and feel their best - I want that! Who doesn't want that? Right?</div><div><br>GOAL: Try to keep it authentic and conversational – get rid of anything too salesy or that just doesn’t feel like you. <br><br><strong><br>II - team work<br></strong>TEAMWORK 1/2 - Get together, read off you answers. How does it sound? How does it FEEL to say them?<br>2. Reading answers SSI together - zero in on a few good options<br>drafts<br><br><strong>III - Group input</strong><br><br>What next?<br>☐ Keep it brief! (10-15 seconds!) This is not the time to describe everything that you do. By keeping it short and poignant, you come across as clear and confident, plus it helps to peak the interest of others. When someone is curious, and asks for more information, you can easily expound more on exactly how you deliver your results. Time yourself:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>IV - pairwork<br>WORKSHEET<br>drafts / time / unstuck</strong><br>MY TIME: ___________&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>☐ Get unstuck! Just because someone asks about what you do does not mean that you must stick to this topic, unless this is exactly what you want. With a Super Savvy Introduction YOU are in control and can easily plan and direct the conversation exactly where you want to go:&nbsp;<br>+dig deeper - "Is this something that you have experience with?"&nbsp;<br>+learn more about the other person - "And what about you?"&nbsp;<br>+branch off into a new topic - "So, tell me about that conference in Berlin."&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>V - team work <br></strong>practice directing the conversation where you want to go...&amp; give feedback<br><br><strong>VI - gather <br></strong>questions / troubleshooting<br><br><strong>VII - conversational practice prep / review of all<br></strong>Here we are at a networking event - lots of people you may or may not know. <br>1. set intention - make new contacts, get your name out there, <br>2. be approachable<br>3. start simple<br>4. pay attention to body language<br><br><strong>VIII - Group Mingle<br><br>VIV - Group Reflect / trouble shoot<br></strong>What happened?<br>What worked - what needs improvement</div><div><br><br><br><br>WORKSHEETS - for workshop<br><br>1.&nbsp; Main frustrations - where is YOUR focus tonight?<br>Why are you here?
