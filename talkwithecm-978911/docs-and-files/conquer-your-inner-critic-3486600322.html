      <div>Conquer Your Inner Critic<br><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="autolinked" data-behavior="truncate" href="https://www.canva.com/design/DADY7CrnrCQ/Q4nNtyJit-xu3L7jTJLCBA/edit">https://www.canva.com/design/DADY7CrnrCQ/Q4nNtyJit-xu3L7jTJLCBA/edit</a>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What is your Inner Critic saying?</strong></div><div>Everyone has an Inner Critic, and each one is as unique and variable as we are. Some messages are harsh and mean:</div><ul><li>Your look stupid/ugly/fat.</li><li>Nobody wants to hear your ideas.</li><li>All of your ‘accomplishments’ were just lucky chances.</li></ul><div>Some are more gentle:</div><ul><li>Just stay home.</li><li>You need a break.</li><li>Have another piece of cake, it won’t make a difference.</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div>All of the messages have one thing in common: The goal is to hold you back and keep you stuck exactly where you are. These messages tend to get a lot louder and more frequent any time you are about to step out of your comfort zone or make a change. That is a big threat to your Inner Critic. Now to be fair, our Inner Critic actually has a very important job to do - keep us safe and protect us from making poor choices. The problem is that sometimes it is difficult to find the ‘off switch’ and the Inner Critic prevents you from making the changes that you want, and creating the life that you desire. I want to show you how to work with your Inner Critic, even if you have a hyperactive critic with a broken ‘off switch!’</div><div><br></div><div>So, you &amp; your Inner Critic already have a long history together and a deep relationship. You have your patterns and have found a way to live with each other...sort of. But it feels like a dysfunctional relationship! The truth is that you can change this dynamic.&nbsp; Here are a few tips to help get you started:</div><div>1. <strong>Get to Know Your Inner Critic</strong> - Recognize the messages from your Inner Critic</div><div>2. <strong>Get real about what your Inner Critic is meant to do </strong>- Frame the messages in a way that actually benefits you</div><div>3. <strong>Changing the Game</strong> - Change your response &amp; listen to your inner coach!</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Get to Know Your Inner Critic</strong></div><div>First, take some time to get to know your Inner Critic. What is it? Who is this person?</div><div>Simply put, your Inner Critic refers to that inner voice that judges, criticizes, or demeans. You might notice these negative messages when you are feeling insecure, alone or even in the moment as you accomplish something great. Self-criticism can come at any time, whether or not it is objectively justified. Your Inner Critic is working full time to protect you and prevent you from doing anything stupid or harmful. Sometimes, a highly active Inner Critic can protect a person too much, and block progress. This kind of hyper-active Inner Critic can really hold a person back, and even take a toll on one's emotional well being and self-esteem.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Get real about what your Inner Critic is meant to do</strong></div><div>Truthfully, your Inner Critic is part of you. It is made up of your memories, experiences and deep rooted fears. Making it simply go away is impossible, but you can learn how to listen and respond in a more productive way.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Greatest Hits</strong></div><div>Listen to your self-talk. What messages do you hear? Are there a few messages that you hear over and over, something like your own personal greatest hits soundtrack?</div><div>What does your Inner Critic say to you?</div><div>Write out a few 2-4 consistent phrases you hear over and over.</div><div><br></div><div>Judge - condemningScaredy Cat - fearful Avoider - avoids difficulty/challenging situationsImposter - you’re a fraud | Victim - blames othersPeople Pleaser - must to be likedPerfectionist - not good enoughController - must be rightDistracter - restless</div><div>Something else?&nbsp;</div><div>Write down the main personified identity that you recognize as your personal Inner Critic</div><div><br><br></div><div><strong>Changing the Game</strong></div><div>Now that you have a list of your own personal ‘greatest hits,’ take a moment to review that list again. Do you recognize these phrases? Many people discover that actually taking the time to write out and review a list of these Inner Critic messages is enlightening. “Those are the things that my mother would say to me.” “That’s the exact thing my ex would say to me!” Check your list - do you recognize some<em>one</em> or some <em>when</em> in your past?</div><div><br></div><div>Now is the time to change the game, to change the way that you heard these messages, the value and attention you give them and the way that you respond. It is time to break free from your patterns and get unstuck!</div><div><br></div><div>There are a lot of different ways to respond to your Inner Critic. I’ve created a list here to help get you started. Use this list and stay committed to yourself and your dream.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>1. Enjoy the ride</strong></div><div>Balance acceptance with personal development. Mistakes and accidents do happen, there is no real way to safeguard against that. Use your Inner Coach to acknowledge that you have flaws but commit to remain a work in progress and strive to keep getting better. While your Inner Critic can help you recognize areas where you need to improve, overly harsh negative self-talk will cause your performance to suffer and block you from making progress. This drastically reduces the chances that you’ll reach your goals. Practice taming your Inner Critic and silencing the negativity so you can use your Inner Coach in a more productive and supportive way.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Want some advice?</strong></div><div>Friends give friends advice - good advice, or at least they try to.</div><div>Ask yourself what advice you’d give to a friend. If a friend expressed feelings of self-doubt, hopefully you wouldn’t say, “You can’t ever do anything right,” or “You’re so stupid. No one likes you.” Yet, we’re often quick to say those hurtful things to ourselves. Instead, you’d be more likely to offer a friend kind and encouraging words like, “You made a mistake but it’s not the end of the world,” or “It's only one day, it's unlikely that you'll lose your job over that.” Treat yourself equally as kind as you’d treat a friend and apply those words of encouragement to your life.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Take a closer look - get accurate</strong></div><div>Convert ‘end of the world’ thinking to more rational and realistic statements. When you find yourself thinking, “I’ll never do anything right,” replace it with a more balanced statement like, “Usually I do things really well and sometimes I don’t.” Each time you find yourself thinking an exaggeratedly negative thought, check yourself and use your Inner Coach to respond with a more accurate statement.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4. Worst case scenario</strong></div><div>How bad would it be if your Inner Critic is actually right? What happens if you take your Inner Critic seriously? Let’s take an example of completely failing during a critical pitch. The power goes out, you forgot your notes, the computer crashes, you fumble and get lost in your words, the manager actually gets up and leaves the table in the middle of your presentation -&nbsp; let your Inner Critic imagine the worst! What is the worst that will happen if you lose the pitch? Are you any worse off than if you don’t even try? Reminding yourself that you actually can handle tough times and problems builds your confidence based on facts and helps quiet a hyperactive Inner Critic.</div><div><br><strong>Here are a few examples:</strong></div><div><strong>Context: </strong>Networking Event - where you don’t know anyone</div><div><strong>Inner Critic:</strong> Why would anyone want to talk to you? You have nothing that they want.</div><div><strong>Inner Coach: </strong>Actually, I do have a lot of value that I can offer. I'm a good listener, I ask thoughtful questions, and I generously share my knowledge to help people solve their problems.</div><div><br><br></div><div><strong>Context: </strong>Job Interview</div><div><strong>Inner Critic:</strong> Everyone is more qualified than you. And besides, they have better experience.</div><div><strong>Inner Coach: </strong>While I'm sure there are many qualified candidates, I have a deep knowledge of the industry and the organization. In fact, I've learned the inside scoop about what they are most interested in through informational interviews with both colleagues and competitors.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Context: </strong>Asking for a raise/promotion</div><div><strong>Inner Critic:</strong> You shouldn’t be so pushy. If they wanted to give you a raise, they’d tell you. Besides all of your ‘accomplishments’ were actually teamwork.</div><div><strong>Inner Coach: </strong>My contributions have been critical to our organization's market leadership. In fact, my efforts at increasing our customer retention and expanding into new markets have contributed to a 15 percent increase in revenue. Also, I'm taking a conversation skills class which is helping me come across with more confidence at meetings.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Now you try it!</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Context:</strong></div><div><strong>Inner Critic:</strong></div><div><strong>Inner Coach:&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br><br></div><div><strong>Context:</strong></div><div><strong>Inner Critic:</strong></div><div><strong>Inner Coach:&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Be aware of the messages you say to and about yourself and how they affect you. If you don't like them, use the techniques above to change them. Remind yourself to do so every day. Speak to yourself - privately and publicly - the way you'd speak to your best friend: with respect and kindness.</div><div></div>
