      <div>Do you freeze up every time you turn on the camera to record a video for your social media? You have a message to share - but you don't know how to tell it.</div><div>I struggled for years to find my self-confidence when giving presentations (on or off camera!). Not because I didn't know what I wanted to say, but because I didn't know how to say it. I didn't know how to act. And when the camera started rolling or all the eyes turned to me, my palms would sweat and it became hard to breathe. Even with a small audience, sometimes my mind would just go blank when it was time to speak.</div><div>Traditional advice on speaking is such rubbish. Move your arms to appear convincing! But don't move so much that you make your audience uncomfortable. Make sure you smile! But not too much, you want to be taken serious.&nbsp; Use more intonation, use a deep voice, blah blah blah.&nbsp;</div><div>What if you could throw all that advice away and just be yourself? The truth is that your audience just wants to connect with you.&nbsp; And&nbsp; I can show you how to stop getting in your own way, and let them.</div><div>I have tossed out all the outdated advice about speaking, and learned to be myself.&nbsp; As soon as I did, my audience engagement went through the roof.&nbsp; I started getting noticed, and getting invitations to speak in front of national audiences, requests to record my presentations for online courses, and people asking me to mentor them.&nbsp; I've given keynote speeches at international conferences.&nbsp; And you&nbsp; know the best part? My audience is so grateful, and I get to hear their stories about how my talk changed their business.&nbsp; All because I learned how to be comfortable with myself, so that I could focus on bringing value to them.&nbsp;</div><div>I can show you how to stop faking it, and help you discover how to make videos that feel like you.&nbsp; So that you can share your message in a way that feels comfortable and authentic, and start making meaningful connections with your videos.&nbsp; Join me for weekly group coaching, where I will guide you through a presentation in a supportive environment.&nbsp; Your videos will be recorded so you can see the incredible progress that you will make - and as an added bonus, when you record a video that you like, my team will transform it into a polished social media video, with your branding, cover and end slides, and subtitles.&nbsp; Come learn how to make great social media videos and feel confident doing it.</div>
