      <div>How to connect with people and communicate beyond your current English language level – go from feeling stuck to <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 228, 247);">your dream job! letting your true self shine, letting people see your true self, connecting with VIPs, networking with top level CEOs, speaking confidently in English, reaching your professional goals, being the life of the party, building a powerful network</span><br><br></div><ul><li>Even if you're shy or reluctant about "networking"</li><li>Even if you you're not confident about speaking English</li><li>Even if you're not sure you have anything to offer others (spoiler alert: you do, and they want it)</li></ul><h1>Start Your Conversation With Success</h1><div><br>Enroll now<br><br>Count down to April 15 (midnight)</div><div><br>I remember sitting in my 5th grade English class, with my hand stretched way up in the air, bouncing up and down, waiting to be called on. I wiggled with excitement, "Pick me! Pick me!" I thought.<br><br>We were learning about impromptu speeches.<br><br>After my name was called, I jumped up out of my seat. <br>I felt excited, adrenaline pumping through my skinny 10 year old veins. My heart started beating a little bit faster. I skipped to the front of the room.<br>Then I slowly turned around &amp; faced the class. A big smile speed across my face. Here I was, at the front. <br>I could feel everyone's eye's on me. <br><br>My teacher leaned back &amp; smiled. He said, "Your topic is....Why girls are better than boys. Begin."<br>....<br>My jaw dropped.<br>I took one short breath. I was nervous and I didn't want to leave too much silence.<br>My mind went blank. I blinked twice. I starting talking, I needed to say something, anything, and repeated the topic I was given. <br>"Why Girls are Better than Boys."<br><br>gulp, my heart stopped beating, my face started turning bright red, <br><br>"This an interesting topic....uh...because....well, One thing about this is that...um"<br>My mouth felt dry and chalky - I had no idea what to say. I was stuck. I didn't know what to do, I remember opening my mouth to speak, but nothing came out. <br><br>After a few more failed attempts to deliver my speech, I sat down, totally disappointed &amp; devastated.<br><br>I felt so small - humiliated.<br><br>For the rest of the class, I sat in my seat, looking down at my hands and tried my best to hold back my tears. I felt so embarrassed. <br><br>I learned two big things that day:<br>1.&nbsp; Some people, even people that we think want to help us, can be jerks - total jerks. Take this teacher - setting a little girl up for failure in front of the entire class. Jerk. <br>2.&nbsp; Inspiring and genius words do not come magically flying through the air exactly when we need them. That stuff takes practice. As I stood there with a classroom of eyes staring at me, I felt so lost that I couldn't have even made an intelligent sentence about my name. <br><br><br><del>2. I made a promise to myself - I had to make a change.&nbsp; I never wanted to feel that way again. I knew that I wanted to go from a flustered, tongue tied little girl struggling to find words to a confident speaker that people want to hear.</del><br><br><em style="background-color: rgb(250, 247, 133);">And so I began the long process of learning not only </em>how to speak well and connect authentically with people but also how give others the tools to succeed as well. Over the past 15+ years I have worked on 3 continents with top level performers. I put in the long hours and nerve-racking all nighters. I watched a large event fall apart during a power outage, and I discovered the one thing that brought everyone together again. Through trial and error, I've learned first hand what it takes to develop messages that work including:</div><ul><li>finding messages to unite people during delicate mergers and mediations,</li><li>making high level sales pitches and opening new markets,&nbsp;</li><li>networking and getting my dream job in a foreign language (!)</li><li>I have even judged a number of high level speech competitions. I was the one who decided who gets the prize money and who just gets a certification of participation.</li></ul><div>What I realized along the way is that NOBODY wants to feel small or stupid.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if it is at a televised press conference or a parent-teacher meeting. Everybody wants to be taken seriously and each person wants to feel heard. <br><br>It's not about the impromptu speeches, or even key note presentations. It's about being able to connect with others on a personal level and inspiring <del>others to take</del> action. It's about confidently walking into a room knowing that when you speak, people will listen. That's why today, when I see a crowd of eyes staring at me, I can relax and smile, because I know that people heard my message and take me seriously. <br><br>How would that feel?<br><br><br>***********<br><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 229, 229);">INTRODUCING START YOUR CONVERSATION WITH SUCCESS</strong><strong><br></strong><br></div><div>Today I am combining what I've learned into one package - My proven system to get unstuck, overcome your fears &amp; speak confidently in English to communicate beyond your current language level &amp; reach your professional goals.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Your ability to connect with people is the single greatest competitive advantage that you can get.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Most English classes are about topics: phrasal verbs, how to talk about the weather, the Emmy awards, whatever - and that's good, but most people find it difficult to apply that to a real life situation - a real life situation where what you do really matters:</div><ul><li>a job interview,&nbsp;</li><li>a networking event,&nbsp;</li><li>a hot new happy hour&nbsp;</li></ul><div>In this course I will show you how to change the way that others see you, so they can finally see the real you that is waiting to come out.&nbsp;<br><br>Act now and gain in 4 weeks what took me over 15 years to learn.&nbsp;<br><br>Don't miss another opportunity and just watch someone pass you by.&nbsp;<br>***<br>(Option A)What you get:<br><br></div><ul><li>small group sessions with me&nbsp;</li><li>unlimited practice time within our private online community</li><li>Weekly challenges and activities for outside the classroom</li><li>Confidence boosting activities</li><li>Personalized vocabulary enhancers&nbsp;</li><li>Engaging emails, worksheets &amp; much more&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>With a focus on building your skills and confidence, every aspect of this course directly linked to you and your personal progress.&nbsp;</li><li>No matter where you are on your journey to success, I will show you exactly what to do step by step to get there.</li></ul><div>In this course, you'll get my STRATEGY&nbsp; - not more grammar rules!<br><br>****</div><div><br>(Option B)What you get:<br>Proven strategies&nbsp;<br>game plans&nbsp;<br>mind maps<br>mental shift<br>perspective change<br>• 3 secrets to guarantee networking success&nbsp;</div><div>• How to stop fumbling around with your words and sound professional&nbsp;</div><div>• Proven techniques to build trust and create intimacy with anyone - even people you've just met</div><div>• Scripts with the exact words you can use to start a conversation that gets results&nbsp;</div><ul><li>How to connect with the right people and boost your career</li><li>How to standout from other equally qualified candidates&nbsp;</li><li>The shy-person's guide to become the person that everyone in your community knows and likes</li><li>&amp; much more!</li></ul><div><br>******<br><br>OPTION C (Description is mix of the sentences of Option A and B)<br><br><strong>Confidence Boosters<br></strong>No matter where you are on your journey to success, I will show you exactly what to do step by step to get there.
