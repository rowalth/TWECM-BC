Maybe you say "I know that I 'should' go online, but...<br>-I just don't know what to say" or<br>-It seems like no matter what I do, I only hear crickets. No one is responding to my posts." or&nbsp;<br>-How do I know if anyone is listening?"<br>If this is you - keep listening.<br><br>Client case study:&nbsp;<br>Yesterday we were talking about a specific client, who went through the process - Magnetic Attraction - and the results were amazing. Mind-blowing. I think it would be interesting for our audience to hear some of the specifics about that. Elizabeth?&nbsp;<br><br><br>I was working with someone…for a webinar…she works in the area of health &amp; fitness, specifically weight loss&nbsp; &amp; wanted to set up an introductory webinar to establish herself as an authority in her field.&nbsp;<br><br>First she started out focused on the what - what is good nutrition …what she offers…what, what, what.<br><br>But she just heard crickets…no one was responding, no one was signing up…actually, she had some - friends, connections, but no real traction. At least not what she was looking for, so that she could quit her job &amp; focus on 100% coaching, her real passion, full time.<br><br>#1<br>So, the first thing we did was add a personal story - a personal touch, something relatable that people could connect with…get to know her on a personal level.&nbsp;<br><br>I wasn’t always like this…talked about HER path to success. Her struggles…relatable to her audience. The best part is that it is all 100% true - no salesy sleazy stuff<br><br>Establish connection.&nbsp;<br><br>#2<br>Secondly, we shifted away from the WHAT to the WHY - why should people listen to her, come to her webinar, etc. I challenged her to leave her safe title behind - How good nutrition and regular workouts can help you lose weight. BORING - SOUNDS LIKE WORK&nbsp; - to “3 ingredient power breakfast: The jumpstart your body needs to get fit &amp; healthy, without spending all day at the gym ”<br><br>Paint the end result - the dream - the desires<br><br>#3<br>Visual connection - this is the big one, especially right now. She did have a few professional photos of herself …but they were mainly of her working, not clear image of her face. So people didn’t even know what she looked like. Her main images were about her work. She had some really great stock images…but it is really difficult to establish yourself as an authority in the field if no one can see you! So adding your face / voice - even if it is a corona-selfie, makes a difference!&nbsp;<br>In fact, we’ve seen it over &amp; over again, non-polished, “amateur shots” outperform professional productions. I know, it seems counter-intuitive. But it is all about being imperfect, vulnerable &amp; relatable. People can connect to that. &amp; the personal connection.&nbsp;<br><br><br>This is an example of Magnetic Attraction…one piece of the Webinar With Ease…<br><br><br>Now- +The limitations brought on by this pandemic - some people are looking for a corona life jacket -<br>&amp; many companies are offering Corona proof - ideas<br>What we are talking about it actually, corona - fueled solution! Yes, a solution that will work better now than ever before BECAUSE of the current pandemic situation:<br>-people are home, looking for new ideas/opportunities / habits, and now is the time to get your face/service/product/solutions front and center and meet your audience, the exact people who want what you have to offer, meet them exactly where they are - at home, in front of the screen…and NOT at an event…and won’t be for the next chunk of time. This is how you can be the one in your niche to actually meet the needs, the desperate needs of your market…<br><br>Right now it is important that you embrace the struggle - not exploit - and get out there -digitally- to find, and actually create opportunities for you to shine - we want to show you exactly how to do all of that. Would you like that? Does that sound good?<br><br>WHY This - we want to give you a complete package with everything you need, everything, a complete system to go from no idea&nbsp; to creating a game changing webinar in 3 weeks &amp; even if you HATE talking to a camera!&nbsp;<br><br>Why us?<br>What makes this class unlike anything else that is being offered right now is that we are combining his digital strength with my communication prowess into one package, all wrapped up for you!<br><br>No one else is offering that -&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>wk 19 -Speaking OUT<ol><li>What are your thoughts about (topic) - which are you? fight/flight/freeze?</li><li>janka interview</li><li>henni quote - we are always enough, but never perfect</li></ol></li></ol><div><br></div><div></div>
