What's working for you, what connections have you made? Tell me about your successes and sticking points. The more details you give me, the better I can help push you forward.<br><br><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);">Last week I went out for coffee with a woman who felt caught in the gap of education and meaningful employment. She couldn't get the jobs she wanted because she didn't have enough experience, but she couldn't get relevant work experience because she couldn't get hired - so frustrating!&nbsp;<br><br>She felt like she had done everything right, but there was still something missing - but what?!? She had-&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);">+The right education</span></div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);">+Impressive internships&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);">+International experience&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);">As told me about her struggles and networking efforts, I quickly asked, "How about your introduction?" I have to admit that she did a great job, super eye contact, open body language...but I noticed that she used only talked about the past, things that had studied and what she had done. There was nothing about what she is doing right now, what she wanted to do in the future, or - more importantly - what she will bring to the table as an employee. <br><br></span>What about you? How do you introduce yourself to others? Are you savvy enough to catch someone's attention in the first 7 seconds and have them curious to learn more?<br><br>I suggest that starting with a 10 second introduction quickly telling others who you are and what you do. These questions come up a lot, and it is not a bad idea to prepare your response in advance. Otherwise you could be stuck, stammering on the spot “Hi, I”m Elizabeth. I…um…help people….talk, you know, communicate? “ Uh-huh -not very impressive, is it?<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;Hi, I’m Elizabeth and I empower busy professionals to overcome the fears that have held them back for years and unleash their true strength. Using English as a vehicle enables my clients to not only flex their language muscles but also feel more confident speaking in any language to expand their reach.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);"><br></span><br></div><ul><li>what are you doing right now?</li><li>where do you want to be in the future?</li><li>what have you learned that you will bring to my company as an employee?</li><li>what can I expect from you?</li></ul><div><br><br><br><br>I want to help you unlock your potential and start creating your own power network. I'm talking about step by step guides so that you can:</div><ul><li><strong>talk to ANYONE</strong></li><li><strong>drive conversations</strong></li><li><strong>make meaningful contacts&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>get your dream job</strong></li></ul><div><br><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);">I recently overheard someone complaining the sh**y job market, how he couldn't get a job. I asked what his experiences were and where he was struggling.&nbsp;</span></div><blockquote><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);">"My CV is good, I get some interviews...but then nothing. Sometimes I get a generic rejection letter...but most of the time it's just silence. Companies are getting so rude."</span></blockquote><div><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);">&nbsp;I was curious, so I asked some more questions about his conversations with potential employers. He told me that he basically uses online application forms and has been sending his CV out everywhere - aiming for 35-40 applications per day. When I asked about practicing for interviews or actually reaching out to specific companies, he rolled his eyes and talked about applying to more online platforms. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);"><br>I smiled and asked how much he knew about the hidden job market. This is where most of the choice jobs are waiting:</span></div><ul><li><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);">75% of the jobs are never even advertised!</span></li><li><span style="background-color: rgb(225, 239, 252);">only about 25% of their vacant positions through a public hiring process. The vast majority of (especially) higher paid jobs are filled through referrals or networking activities.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><div><br><br>So if you, or someone you know, is looking for a job and is already getting frustrated by sending out piles of CVs, it is time for a better solution. <br><br>Most people, like the man above, take their chances with a numbers game, where the only way to get hired is to flood the market with applications. Everyone knows that networking is a good idea, but it can be difficult to even know how to start. <br><br>(TK image of HIRE ME)<br><br>Honestly, with today's hiring practices and new digitization trends a lot of the rules are changing. <br><br>But don't lose hope, there is a lot you can do <strong>right now</strong> to help differentiate yourself from other applicants. <br><br>If you are curious about increasing your own chances on the hidden job market and you are ready to unlock your networking skills, check out my course -<br><em>Start Your Conversation With Success</em><a href="https://dripscripts.growthtools.com/s/:%20http://unlockyourtheme.com/getnoticed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong><br><br></strong></a><br></div><div>I'm excited to share these powerful tools with you.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>If you have any questions before you register, just hit 'reply'!<br></strong><br></div><div>- ecm<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S.

This means that you can work through the course materials (videos, workbooks, challenges, etc.) on your own schedule. That means - with your morning coffee, on your evening commute, before heading out to meet some coworkers for drinks, whatever works for you! This course is completely flexible to match your schedule.&nbsp;<br><br>As an additional bonus, you'll also be invited to join:</div><ul><li>Weekly Open Office Hours with me</li><li>Our exclusive accountability group&nbsp;</li></ul><div>2. <strong>Is the payment system secure?<br>&nbsp;</strong>Yes! All payments are processed using a Stripe integration through WishList Member. Your card information never touches our servers—only the PCI-compliant servers of Stripe.&nbsp;</div><ul><li>We are also offering different options to pay: lump sum &amp; split payment plan</li></ul><div><br></div><div>3. <a href="https://lp.talkwithecm.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>I feel awkward talking to people, even in my own language. How can this course help me?</strong></a><br><br>This course is not only about using the English language, I will also show you how to authentically connect with people and develop contacts.

I think a small part of me expected companies to reach out and contact me with exciting career opportunities... YIKES - did I have a lot to learn!<br><br><strong>&amp; Now...</strong><br>Since then a lot has changed, email, digitization, automation, and I have made it my mission to dig deep into the psychology and patterns of human interactions and learn exactly what it takes to differentiate yourself the masses, make the connections you want and get your dream job. <br><br>The biggest thing that I've learned is that no one can see who you are and all of the great value and experience you have, until you show them. That means developing a clear strategy to attract others, building strong connections and delivering value consistently over time. <br><br>I have packaged this information up into the 9 core elements of my course - <em>Start Your Conversation With Success -</em> I am ready to share this information with you.<br><br><strong>Getting the right answers&nbsp;</strong></div><div>Over the last few days, I've had great conversations with people who had questions about the my course—but back-and-forth email just wasn't enough.<br><br></div><div>So I have decided to offer others who are still unsure a FREE 20 minute consultation call with me. <br><br>That's right, I said, FREE - with no obligations or strings attached. <br><br>Think of it as a gift, from me to you, so that you can get <strong>ultra clear</strong> about what this course is about and if it is the right fit for you.
