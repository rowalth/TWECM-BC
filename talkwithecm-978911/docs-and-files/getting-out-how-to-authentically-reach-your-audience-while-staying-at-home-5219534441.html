So, yes, please do answer my questions &amp; give feedback right there in the comments section. That will help a lot. I have to say that I’ve already&nbsp; heard from so many people - &amp; it WEIRD, right?</div><div><br></div><div>Our new normal.</div><div><br></div><div>Down sides -<strong> list them</strong> LONELY, bored, cut off, frustrated, alone</div><div><br></div><div>Up sides - trying new things, making new plans, new habits, getting really crazy creative - <strong>what have you been doing? Baking? New exercise program? Planning to make a new fitness plan??</strong><br> have you seen those images of people recreating famous paintings at home?? Amazing&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Listen, If you work for a company, if you're looking for a job, if you have your own business, if you are concerned about your income because of the pandemic, if you are a human on the planet earth - this applies to you. So pay attention!</div><div><br></div><div>We all want to get through this alive and well, right? I want that, you want that, heck, I want that for you too! Now, What's going to help you survive this crisis AND give you exactly what you need to come out of this with upward momentum 3 weeks from now, 3 months from now, heck 5 years from now?&nbsp;<br>What is it??<br>What's going to make a difference for you, your family, your mental health, you band account???<br>Connections - relationships, knowing the right people at the right time to connect you with the opportunities you need.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And how are you going to get these important connections &amp; nurture relationships? This is so important. It is essential that you think about this right now so that your skills &amp; strategy don’t fall behind &amp; become another economic casualty of this pandemic.</div><div><br></div><div>I don’t want that to happen to you.<br><br>It's all about getting social&nbsp;<br>I’m talking about doing the OPPOSITE of social distancing!&nbsp;</div><div>GOING full on SOCIAL with Social connecting&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;wait, wait, wait - what about Social distancing?!? There is a pandemic going on right now!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Right - I am all for physical distancing AND social connecting&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>NOW is the time for Social Connection- with physical distancing</div><div><br></div><div>&amp; this is where YOU come in! If you are interested in reaching out to people, while staying safely at home, this is for you!</div><div><br></div><div>I want to talk about ways that YOU can get creative &amp; stand out from the crowd and get your brand or service or offer in front of your audience - right now! Without being sleazy or weird about it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Generally we are social creatures &amp; one thing I often talk about is relationships - relationships are so important for every aspect of your life - do you want to be successful socially, romantically, politically even professionally? No matter where or how you want to succeed - It all comes back to relationships</div><div><br></div><div>Even if you are the very best candidate for a position, I can’t give it to you - I can’t hire you-&nbsp; until I know that you exist! It’s pretty simple. And the stronger our connection, the more likely you name is going to pop up when that choice position &amp; great opportunities come up - basically when it really counts!<br>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Tell me, is this something you are interested in knowing more about?</strong> Are you ready to have your audience - the exact people you want to listen to what you have to say - tuning into you &amp; getting excited about your product/service / offer - whatever it is that you do.</div><div>IF yes - Make a comment on the side &amp; let me know</div><div><br></div><div>People are looking for new things, things to help them cope with this new situation.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Companies like Netflix are already out there - front and center, meeting people where they are. I’ve seen musicians, theaters &amp; more offering free stuff - getting their name out there, even while their shows are canceled.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<strong>What about YOUR audience? Where’s your audience??</strong>&nbsp;</div><div>Write a comment, let me know.&nbsp;</div><div>Who do you want to be in front of right now? Top level CEOs? digital marketers? Busy professionals who need a childcare solution RIGHT NOW</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Actually, Doesn’t matter - we are all in the same boat!&nbsp;</div><div>If you are looking for a job, if you have your own business, if you are looking for more clients or you simply want to build up your brand - now is the time.</div><div><br></div><div>People are online more than ever &amp; now is the time to meet them exactly where they are &amp; reach out and add value!</div><div><br></div><div>Fb live!</div><div>Medium / reddit / where are the people that you want to talk to hanging out?</div><div>Send an email</div><div>Start the conversation</div><div>Get involved</div><div>Webinar&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>TIPS:</div><div>&nbsp;because right now many of us crave connection - more than ever before</div><div><br></div><div>Example - saying hello out our window - we got the BIGGEST SMILES</div><div><br></div><div>VIDEO - because right now many of us crave connection - connection, a listening ear, someone that can say ‘ hi - I see you!</div><div><br></div><div>Connection during this time when everything seems so strange and bizarre.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Connection to another human being, someone who says, " yes! I'm here- I hear you!"</div><div><br></div><div>This is what people are looking for - this is what people want deep down, even if they don't even realize they want it. so now it is time for a shift, a new plan - new program - this is where YOU come in.</div><div><br></div><div>If you want to get ahead, of you want to come out on top, if you are looking for away to get you and your family set up for financial stability for the next 3 weeks, 3 months heck for the next 5 years - now is the time to make a shift - a simple yet incredibly powerful mindset shift to change the way you interact with people, because the old ways just aren’t going to cut it right now.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I’m working on a new project called Webinar with Ease which is a complete package with everything, I mean every&nbsp; single thing you need to create a game changing webinar, you know the kind that I'm taking about, A webinar that will:</div><ul><li>Establish you as an authority figure</li><li>Set you up as the goto person in your niche</li><li>Build trust with your audience - break away from all the scammy crap that is out there</li><li>Help you get to actually know your audience: what they are going through RIGHT NOW - what they think, what they feel, what they want &amp; what they will pay for</li><li>Explode your email list</li><li>Develop an ongoing relationship with your customers - so they'll keep coming back for more</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>So, tell me, do those things sound interesting to you? is that something YOU want?
