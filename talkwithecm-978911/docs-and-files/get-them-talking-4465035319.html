      <div>There are two types of movie watchers. Those who like to have the full cinematic experience and those who like to be at home with full access to snacks&nbsp;<br><br>I am very much a cuddle up with my blanket &amp; someone I love<br><br>And no one will change my mind!&nbsp;<br><br>Which type are you?<br><br><br><br>___________________<br><br>I have a friend who describes herself as punctuationally sensitive. A misplaced period can seem like an act of aggression to her!&nbsp;<br><br>One of the things guaranteed to rile me up is when my eyebrows are rubbed the wrong way<br><br>I just can’t help reacting to it! It seems small but the effect is HUGE<br><br>What is something small which really niggles at you?<br><br>___________<br><br>On the weekends, I turn into a complete a once upon a time weekend partier who now would love to have a Friday night alone and I am completely shameless about it!<br><br>Sure, I use the weekend to get chores, groceries, family visits etc. done as well, I mean what else are the weekends for but the inner weekender in mind cannot but help to unleash my weekend-me.<br><br>What do you turn into on the weekend? We’re all friends here, don’t be shy or ashamed.<br><br>___________<br><br>We’re all going on a Summer holiday,<br>No more workin' for a week or two<br>Sang the heart-throb of yesteryear, Cliff Richard<br><br>And that’s exactly what a holiday is all about.&nbsp;<br>No. More. Working.<br>Just chillaxing in whatever way you do chillaxing<br><br>You may be a;<br>1. Sun, sea, and sun-tan kinda gal&nbsp;<br>2. Culture vulture; museums, landmarks, local cuisines<br>3. Spa Sovereign; wraps, facials, seaweed masks, massages, the works<br>4. Thrill Seeker: Kayaking, scuba diving, mountaineering, hiking, if it involves action, count me in!<br><br>I am kind of a total explorer, take me somewhere new type and my favorite way to unwind and really get into the spirit of a vacation is to push myself to do things I have never done before.<br><br>What is your holiday goer type?</div><div>___________<br><br>Android or Apple<br>Mac or Windows<br>Morning or Night<br><br>Any of these topics will start a debate, but that last option has people judging and hating.<br><br>I am a a blanket cuddling refuse to get out of bed NOT a morning person and I cannot imagine living any other way.&nbsp;<br><br>Are you the early bird that catches the worm or are you a creature of the night?</div><div>__________<br><br>Most families like to spend time bonding over meals out, picnics in the country, maybe weekend camping trips - we take things to the extreme! (Holly Branson)<br><br>Yeah yeah Holly Branson, daughter of stinking-reeking-rich dude Richard Branson, no need to show off, there is nowt wrong with bonding over a meal. Besides, food is very important for survival anyway.<br><br>Anyway, my weekend rituals make me a a once upon a time weekend partier who now would love to have a Friday night alone<br><br>A: Absolutely NOTHING productive + slob out!<br>B: What’s this “weekend” that you speaketh of?<br>C: I have a life; things to do, people to see<br>D: Hobbies…I has hobbies, my preciousssss!<br><br>Tell me, how do you “weekend” away?</div><div>________<br><br>Style is a reflection of your attitude and your personality. Shawn Ashmore, you judgemental so and so (growl), were you talking about me when you said that?! (Not that you know me of course).<br><br>My style reflects my mood, and it largely depends on the weather seeing as it’s so predictably unpredictable (means rain and cold with split-second dashes of summer)<br><br>Otherwise I would class myself as a a twirly skirt lover when it comes to personal style.<br><br>Surely I am not alone in my sense of style…...am I? Tell me, show me...</div><div>_______<br><br>How do you eat yours? Asks the Cadbury’s Creme Egg advert.<br>I’m asking you, what are your eating habits? (I hate you already if you are A, B C, or D)<br><br>A: Eat whatever’s in sight, with ZERO consequences (I’m basically a goat)<br>B: Sugar-free, fat-free, carbs-free, zero preservatives, kinda jazz<br>C: Calorie controlled meals only, all prepped per week<br>D: I breathe in the scent of food and I’m done for the day<br><br>As for me, I am a total the skinniest foodie you'll probably ever meet<br><br>You dare try to judge me, I say go stuff yourselves (pun intended).</div><div><br></div><div></div>
