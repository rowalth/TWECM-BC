In weak moments you question if you should even bother.</div><div><br></div><div>If you're really honest with yourself, sometimes it feels like you're trapped in a hamster wheel, running as fast as you can, but not really moving forward at all. Deep in your heart, you know that you have real value to offer, but you feel invisible. Maybe you see glimpses of your tired and frustrated face when you look in the mirror, or the dread in the pit of your stomach as you lie awake at night...and, if something doesn't change?&nbsp;<br>How much longer can this go on?&nbsp;<br>How much longer can you keep doing what you've been doing before you reach a breaking point?<br><br></div><div>Hi, I'm Elizabeth and I used to have that look in my eyes. I saw my own exhausted face reflected in my daughter's eyes, and I hated it. I knew I had to make a change, for her, for me, for all of us.<br><br></div><div>I hated not really being seen or recognized for my hard work, and everything I did felt scammy or like just an expensive hobby.<br><br></div><div>I was sick and tired of watching others succeed while I felt stuck on the hamster wheel, just watching from the sidelines, waiting and wondering if my turn would ever come.<br><br></div><div>Then I discovered the number one thing holding me back:<br>- it has nothing to do with my eduction or experience<br>- it is not about how I look or sound<br>- it was all about my Inner Critic!&nbsp;<br><br>That sneaky beast inside my own mind, getting louder and more active, ready to sabotage me any time I even thought about putting myself out there and trying something new.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I did my research, listened to experts and spent a few years digging deep into old memories and patterns...and if you have time for that, great! But most of us don't!&nbsp;<br><br>That's why I decided to change the game, crack the code and create a new system -&nbsp;<br>one that would set my soul on fire, enable me to rise above those negative thoughts that held me back, authentically reach out to my audience and unlock extraordinary transformations for my clients.<br><br></div><div>I made it my mission to break the curse of "not enough," smash the myth of "just work harder," and today I show others how to do the same.<br><br><br>But Elizabeth - How is it possible to change something that is so core to who I am?</div><ul><li>Yes - you can change the dynamic! Here's the 4 step process I use to put people on the fact track to overcoming their fears and a speaking out:</li></ul><ol><li>Getting to know your Inner Critic - deep dive to objectively hear those messages</li><li>Getting real about how your Inner Critic is meant to help you - reframing the conversation to boost your confidence</li><li>Changing the Game - Setting a clear intention for moving forward</li><li>Activating Your Inner Coach - with clear frameworks to change the way you hear these messages, the value you give then and the way that you respond.</li></ol><div><br>But Elizabeth - This sounds like a bunch of psycho-feely stuff. Is this like a therapy session?</div><ul><li>No, although many people find it extremely helpful to dive deep with a psychotherapist, this toolkit is all about putting you on the fast track with tools to see the patterns that hold you back, and the resources to build your confidence so that you can speak out within a few days.</li></ul><div>But Elizabeth - I feel awkward speaking out even in my own language. How can this help me?</div><ul><li>This toolkit is about taking a clear look at the messages we tell ourself, where the messages come from and how they are actually meant to help us. Then I offer tools to reshape those messages, both how you hear then and the value you give them. This course offers you key mindset shifts and the tools to not only increase your value and support English speaking skills, it is also about speaking out and sharing your value with others in a way that only you can.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>But Elizabeth - I'm an introvert/shy/awkward. Will this work for me? I don't think I could ever make videos and presentations like you do.<br><br></div><ul><li>Some labels that we carry are learned and therefore changeable (shy/awkward) and some are not (introvert/extrovert). There is guidance inside the toolkit to help you navigate these labels and models for how you can use them to your advantage. The main value of this toolkit is putting <em>you</em> in control of the conversation, empowering <em>you </em>to decode the invisible scripts and limiting beliefs that you carry. Perhaps best proof that this system works&nbsp; - I'm an introvert!</li></ul><div>But Elizabeth - This sounds interesting, but I don't have time now, can I do this next year?</div><ul><li>It is true. Everyone thinks that they are busy, but if you don't invest in yourself now, when will you do it? Next year, in 10 years, 20? You are only putting off the benefits. As a working mom, I am no stranger to pandemic mama drama! I strive to remove all fluff and nonsense and only give you valuable content. Practical content that you can apply and put to use right away. This toolkit, and all of my offers, are designed to change the way you connect with others starting from day one. That's an instant benefit!&nbsp;<br>In addition, you can chose when and where you want to access the material. On the bus, during your morning coffee, whatever, each piece is flexible to match your schedule. Most of the materials can be taken in small chunks (5-10 minutes). Even the 1:1 live session will be recorded and shared with you, so that you can have it as a permanent resource and look back anytime.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>But Elizabeth - How do I know if this is any good?<br><br></div><ul><li>On this page I've talked about what I do and some of the many ways that you'll benefit from working with me. I offer free materials on my website that you can check out. I've posted testimonials from people who know my work in the next section. If this is not enough to convince you about the quality of my work and the value that I offer - I always stand behind my work and give a 100% money back guarantee. If you demonstrate that you did the work and don't see any results, I will give you your money back, no questions asked.</li></ul><div><br><br></div><div>I'm regularly blown away by the dramatic changes my trainings and guidance have given others, giving them the key to speak out with confidence so that they can finally be seen and recognized for who they really are. I love reading the stories they share with me about how they now feel the freedom of confidently speaking out, making meaningful connections and living life on their own terms.<br><br>Here one particularly touching story I received in April:<br>“There's often a battle in my head with my mom and her words, her view of the world, her suspicious and cliticising approach towards pretty much everything. This is "in my system" after so many childhood years of hearing the same things over and over again. So it is really an effort to stop, think and rewrite these automatic reactions, comments, judgement, frustration and anger. Sometimes it's tough being in my head&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>BUT, while working today with an "issue" at work, I just realized that it is so much easier now to do this because I've also added to my "repertoire" of experiences some unique moments when YOU demonstrated empathy, care, genuine concern about others.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank You! ”&nbsp; - Anna<br><br>Here's what others are saying:<br>"I can't believe the difference! It's like I was living behind a fog that has finally lifted...I feel more confident starting conversations now, even with people I don't even know." Sandra<br><br>"Thanks! Thanks! Thanks! I feel so free - I am not afraid of my inner demons anymore." - Chris<br><br>"I had no idea how much I'd been holding myself back all these years. Crazy. So glad I invested the time to get clear about my real value. I applied for my dream job &amp; have an interview next week! Can't wait!" A.J.</div><div><br><br></div><div>If you want to feel that spark of taking control and breaking free from your old patterns, so that you can feel empowered to attract the right kind of attention, impress your audience and finally show your Inner Critic who is boss - you can get step by step support to and start speaking out with confidence today.<br><br></div><div>I am here to help you gain a deeper understanding of your inner critic, so that you can finally flip the switch, take control of the conversation and start winning the game.<br><br>If you can feel your heart flutter at the idea, get started here:<br>Conquer Your Inner Critic Toolkit&nbsp;<br><br></div><ol><li>Who is your Inner Critic - deep dive to objectively hear those messages</li><li>How is your Inner Critic is meant to help you - reframing the conversation to boost your confidence</li><li>Changing the Game - Setting a clear intention for moving forward</li><li>Activating Your Inner Coach - with clear frameworks to change the way you hear these messages, the value you give then and the way that you respond.</li></ol><div><br>100% online - easy access - to match your needs:</div><div>+ Step by step guidance &amp; email support throughout the process</div><div>+ On demand Videos &amp; webinar<br>+ Workbook / worksheets<br><br></div><div>Plus Bonuses:<br>+ How to speak confidently with Janka Ulbricht - webinar on demand <br>+ Powerful Video Creators: Banish Anxiety And Let Your Voice Be Heard - Conquer Your Inner Critic Q&amp;A session (recorded)<br><strong>+ 1:1 Personal session with me (40 min) &lt;- my brain on tap for you! This alone is worth it!</strong><br><br><br>So, I've told you about the benefits, how it works, the support, the bonuses and the money back guarantee, now the choice is yours:<br><br>- You can grab the toolkit and work with me to experience a whole new way to be seen, heard and respected in your field<br>- You can work with a psychotherapist (1000's euros &amp; the next 6-8 months) to dig deep and discover the hidden memories of your childhood<br>- You can do nothing, and just keep doing what you've been doing, waiting for your chance to get in the game.<br><br>The choice is yours -</div><div><br>Because there is NO WAY you want to:</div><ul><li>stay STUCK -&gt; held back by limiting beliefs: I'm too shy - I can't do that - Others are better than me...</li><li>&nbsp;sit on the SIDELINES -&gt; just waiting &amp; watching others (with lame-o offers) get ahead</li><li>&nbsp;get LOST in the endless trap of courses/learning/training waiting for it to finally be your turn to shine</li></ul><div>And <strong>you NEVER want to outsource your words or your voice to someone else. Period.<br></strong><br></div><div>Here's to creating meaningful conversations, successful relationships and life that lights you up!</div>
