Practicing before a live audience makes the actual speech less stressful.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Consider recording your practice sessions. You’ll gain insight on areas of your speech and delivery that you can make more effective.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>2. <strong>Focus on your posture, both on and off the stage. </strong>Maintaining good posture when you walk, stand, and sit helps to increase your oxygen levels and blood flow.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Having the proper posture can boost your mood and makes it easier to project your voice across the room during your speech.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>3. <strong>Reduce anxiety before your speech with regular exercise. </strong>Moderately 1&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>strenuous exercise that elevates your heart rate can help you to relax and unwind in the days leading up to your speech.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong><em><br>Many times, a case of nerves or stage fright is simply pent up energy, </em></strong>which can easily be released through regular exercise such as brisk walking or even dancing!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>4. <strong>Make a connection with your audience.</strong>You can calm your nerves and make your audience more receptive to the content in your speech by building rapport.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Walk into the room with your head held high and <strong><em>make eye contact with members of your audience.&nbsp;<br></em></strong><br></div><div><br>Put yourself and others at ease by telling a lighthearted joke or funny anecdote before you dive into the heart of your speech.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Vary the rhythm and pitch of your voice as you deliver your speech to hold your audience's interest.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>5. <strong>Before you deliver your speech, visualize its success. </strong>Our subconscious minds are powerful tools.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Trick your brain into helping you achieve the result you desire. Whatever your mind focuses on, your subconscious mind will try to achieve. <strong><em>If you visualize your speech going off without a hitch, your subconscious mind will work to make it a success!&nbsp;<br></em></strong><br></div><div><br>6. <strong>Be yourself and have fun. </strong>Most of us can spot a phony a mile away, and audiences are no exception!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>When you deliver a speech, seek a way to present some part of you that is authentic. Being open, honest, and professional will help your audience to connect with you and trust your message.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>If you feel anxiety start to build as you deliver your speech, take a moment to take a deep breath and slowly exhale before you resume speaking to regain your control.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>2&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Accept that you are human. <strong><em>Worrying about making a mistake when you’re giving a speech will only increase the likelihood of it happening. </em></strong>If you do make a mistake, simply correct it and move on.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Public speaking can cause even the bravest hearts to quiver, but these tricks can help you banish your stage fright and deliver a winning performance.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>3&nbsp;</div>
