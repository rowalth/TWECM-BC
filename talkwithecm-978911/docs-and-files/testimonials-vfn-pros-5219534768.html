I‘m so glad you enjoyed using the space. It was lovely to see it so busy.<br><br>I wanted to tell you about a workshop I went to at the Wirtschaftsagentur yesterday as I'm not sure if many people know about these but I found it to be an exceptionally useful resource. They have various workshops in English and other languages. The trainer was very competent and answered lots of questions for many of us. There is a full schedule here, maybe something worth sharing with the group? <a href="https://viennabusinessagency.at/workshops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://viennabusinessagency.at/workshops/</a><br>- Fiona Wood<br><br>I've noticed your efforts, I think you are doing a great job promoting the group!<br>Miglena Hoferm<br><br>Thanks for your e-mail!

I have registered already and looking forward to it!<br>- Milica Ivankovic<br><br><br>Thanks for the add &amp; well done to have created a group that is so timely &amp; resonates so much with moms in Vienna!&nbsp;<br>- Katherine Price Beuchert<br><br><br>Thanks a lot for the invitation. It's a pity I will not make it, I will be on a business trip next week. Which is precisely one of the questions I would like us to discuss in the group: How can we balance family and professional life? How do you deal with business trips when you cannot rely on relatives in Vienna and both parents work, etc?</div><div>I'm sure you'll have a great meeting and I'm looking forward to joining you next time.<br>Maria Munozmorales<br><br><br>thank you very much for this great initiative!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is a very hot topic and It is fantastic that so many people have replied and are eager to meet up!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>first of all thank you once again for creating the VFN Professional group and for organizing the Kick off meeting!<br>- Claudia Cordie (former VFN President)</div><div><br>My quarterly targets for now (ie through end of October) are (in that order):</div><div><br></div><ul><li>connect with like-minded people</li><li>boost my professional networking skills</li><li>find a (new, local) mentor</li><li>- Xiao Chen</li></ul><div>I like the community atmosphere, the sounding board nature of the discussions which are authentic and real.</div><div>I think that where you are coming from is an enormous asset for many members of</div><div>VBC.<br>Aine Morgan-Bauer<br><br>Thank you for your fast response.</div><div>First of all, i would like to meet the working mothers and ask any tipps how to organize the households. Also are there any tipps to manage working from home with a child. It would be interesting to hear the experience of the mothers. My daughter can sit 1-2 hours next to me and draw. I think it is pretty much well. After that i offer her different activities and, of course, it is not easy to keep child indoors all day long.&nbsp;</div><div>First my objective is getting some ideas how to manage to be a mommy and work full day.</div><div><br></div><div>Second, I am looking for a new job. So I want to know how to decrease overtimes and still stay attractive as a potential employee.</div><div><br></div><div>I don’t believe in work-life balance. Nevertheless I would like to keep my child next to me as much as possible.</div><div><br>- Begayym Tolomusheva<br><br><br>Elizabeth dear, you are such a wonderful organizer! Hat's off to you!<br>Diana Mayer<br><br>Hello Elizabeth!</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for the initiative to form this group! I was very happy being a part of VFN and I loved meeting with other mums and their babies (later toddlers). The best of being a part of the VFN was exchanging experiences and ideas and above all - supporting each others. As I am an expat in this country, without family and lot of friends - the group was just the right thing for me.</div><div><br></div><div>Having this great experience with VFN, I would expect the same (if not more) from Professionals. I assume that working parents will be members? The problem with VFN was that we were mix of both, and 1 year after (when I went back to work) I could not manage to join the most of the meetings - scheduled during my working hours.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I do expect that through this new group I will be able to meet others with similar "roles" (as parent &amp; professional) and learn from their experience (how to manage both). I see that with time the "challenges" are changing, and priorities as well - so having someone to turn to would be great. Also, on the professional side, I want to improve and do more of courses, trainings, improve German, learn about the system in Austria -&nbsp; so with other members wanting/doing the same would be easier.</div><div><br></div><div>The biggest value of the group is Exchange - in my opinion. And I am happy to help others.</div><div><br></div><div>Would be happy to hear more from you and to meet soon!</div><div>Milica Ivankovic<br><br>Very professional! Way to go, Elizabeth!&nbsp;<br>-Erin Kogan<br><br>Thank you so much and thumbs up for making this happen!&nbsp;<br>- Elena Jansa<br><br>Thank you so much Elizabeth.<br><br>Beautifully written email. Great professionalism. Well done.<br>- Britta Pichler<br><br>Thank you so much for initiating such a wonderful idea to form a group for professional mothers. Please add me to the network.</div><div><br></div><div>Look forward to hear more and be part of it soon!<br>- Angela Kuo<br><br><br>Thank u for your email&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now I am working in Iraq</div><div><br></div><div>But my family is living in Vienna</div><div><br></div><div>I would like to find some opportunities for me and start my carrier in Vienna</div><div><br></div><div>But what cv looks like especially for Austria have to find out, plus local market chances<br>- Olga Talamai<br><br>Thank you for the great initative.<br>-Renata Mosoci<br><br>I'm interested in sharing ideas on how to manage family and work (I work full time and have a 21 months old daughter), tips when looking for a new job, networking would be also great.</div><div>- Petya Ivanova-Suarez<br><br><br></div><div>thanks for taking the initiative to create a VFN Professionals Group!<br>- Kathrin Humphrey<br><br>&nbsp;Thank you so much for organising.<br>- Natalie Doyle<br><br>Thank you for your initiative!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Many thanks in advance<br>- Henrietta Haber<br><br>Meetups to exchange ideas and best practises would be great.</div><div><br></div><div>I am interested in topics of stay-at-home dad / part time / remote work / reliable childcare.<br>- Feri Hromada<br><br>I'm looking forward to shaping a new group :)</div><div><br></div><div>Questions I have:</div><div>How do you go about finding family friendly employment? At the moment it seems like as soon as I mention wanting to do 32 hours a week everyone drops me as a candidate.</div><div>How do you balance job and family? I've never had so many problems enjoying life around work and kids. But I used to work 33 hours and was not forced to do 40+ hours.</div><div>Are others facing the same issues around kindergarten/hours/dr. visits/etc?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At the moment what would help me is just some friendly faces, talking in English, enjoying a laugh. A bit of venting together :)</div><div>Otherwise, I think tips and tricks of how to stay on top of things at home and with the kids while being viewed as a terrible mother by society and the kindergarten.</div><div><br></div><div>In the long run I'd like to become self employed but I'm struggling to see myself working crazy hours alone... So a platform to find likeminded people who I could bounce ideas off would be brilliant.</div><div><br>- Simona Ecker-Zach<br><br><br>I think it's a great idea!<br>Many Thanks!<br>Maria del Pilar Munoz Morales<br><br>**************<br>from Sept 18 meeting:<br><br><br><br>Organisation was perfect. Well structured and interesting, being eager to see what comes next - I liked it very much. With so many new faces I was not expecting it to be so relaxed! During the dinner we had chance to get to know each others and hear the stories behimd the faces. For the first meeting - a big success! Thank you<br><br>Nice! As a teacher it reminded me of early school year excerises.<br><br><br><br>Just what I was looking for, a space (or group of people) where I could share my new world (my children and my professional life)<br><br>Brilliant. So open and friendly<br>pleasant, fast-paced, motivating&nbsp;<br><br>Really welcoming and positive, with good energy.<br><br>A kind of friendly work space&nbsp;<br>Sometimes a bit too structured, but kept to time. Grpup in the forming stages, which is good to take time to do but also is tough because once a month meetings are so far apart. How long until we are “morning” and “performing”?<br><br>Friendly, a bit unconventional, everything seemed to work really natural<br>Brilliant and friendly<br><br></div><div><br><br><br></div><div></div>
