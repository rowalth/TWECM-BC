      <blockquote><strong><br>SUBJECT: UCSD soph will be in NYC next week - coffee?<br></strong><br><br>Hi Ramit,<br><br><br>My name is Michelle and I'm a sophomore at UCSD, where I'm studying technology and psychology. I'll be in New York next week and was wondering -- can I take you to coffee?<br><br><strong><br>[MUTUAL CONTACT #1] and [MUTUAL CONTACT #2] </strong>actually suggested I get in touch. I've been working on a persuasive technology project that might be interesting for your work at IWT.<br><br><br>How does next Thursday, 4/20 or Friday, 4/21 work? I'm free all day, especially the afternoon, and I can meet whenever is convenient for you.<br><br><br>Thanks,<br><br><br>- Michelle<br><br><br>My cell: XXX-XXX-XXXX<br><br><br>That email worked, but let me show you why.<br><br><br>If she had just invited some busy person to coffee, they would have said no. The blunt truth is that busy people get too many coffee invitations.<br><br><br>But she went a step further -- she (1) named mutual connections we have, and (2) got more specific about why she wants the meeting.<br><br><br>That’s it! It’s not complicated, but having those relationships matters.<br><br><br>If you want to <a href="http://email.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/eE0gzZ00000KZm0qrnqKS03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">build real relationships with people who can help you</a>, pay attention to 5 things Michelle did:<br><br><ul><li>She referenced two people who I knew, liked, and trusted. If they’re suggesting I get coffee with someone, I’m probably going to like them.</li><li>Her subject line (“UCSD soph will be in NYC next week - coffee?”) was phrased as an active question.</li><li>She came out swinging with something we have in common (an interest in technology and psychology).</li><li>She hints at “a persuasive technology project that might be interesting for your work at IWT.” Intriguing, but not hitting me over the head with an aggressive sales pitch. I want to know more!</li><li>Her ask was specific, but flexible. (“How does next Thursday, 4/20 or Friday, 4/21 work? I'm free all day, especially the afternoon, and I can meet whenever is convenient for you.”) I can tap out a short “yes” to one of those dates or toss out a date of my own choosing.</li></ul><br>Michelle’s email was crisp. It was interesting. And it was actually exciting! One minute earlier I had no clue who she was, but now I wanted to know what this “special project” was.<br><br><br><strong><br>Use these email scripts to meet anyone<br></strong><br>Follow these steps:<br><br><ol><li>Brainstorm list of 10 people you’d like to could connect with. Start with these people: People who have a job title you’re interested in learning more about. People who work at companies you’re interested in potentially working at. And people who are doing interesting things you want to learn more about (e.g., you read about them in a magazine/blog post).</li><li>Get their email address. If you can’t find this you fail at life. But you read this site so I suspect you’re cool.</li><li>Use these scripts —</li></ol><br>To: Jane<br>From: Samantha<br>Subject: Michigan State grad — would love to chat about your work at Deloitte<br><br>Hi Jane,<br><br>My name is Samantha Kerritt. I’m a ’04 grad from Michigan State (I know you were a few years before me) and I came across your name on our alumni site. [TELL THEM HOW YOU CAME ACROSS THEIR NAME SO YOU DON’T SEEM LIKE A CREEP]<br><br>I’d love to get your career advice for 15-20 minutes. I’m currently working at Acme Tech Company, but many of my friends work in consulting and each time they tell me how much they love their job, I get more interested. [THE FIRST SENTENCE SAYS WHAT SHE WANTS. MOST PEOPLE ARE FLATTERED THAT PEOPLE WANT/VALUE THEIR ADVICE.<br><br>Most of them have told me that if I’m interested in consulting, I have to talk to someone at Deloitte. Do you think I could pick your brain on your job and what motivated you to choose Deloitte? I’d especially love to know how you made your choices after graduating from Michigan State. [THE PHRASE “PICK YOUR BRAIN” IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ASK FOR ADVICE AND FLATTER, AND “MICHIGAN STATE” REINFORCES SHARED BOND]<br><br>I can meet you for coffee or at your office…or wherever it’s convenient. I can work around you! [THE BUSY PERSON IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU. TREAT THEM ACCORDINGLY.]<br><br>Would it be possible for us to meet? [A BUSY PERSON CAN SIMPLY REPLY TO THIS WITH A “YES” — PERFECT. NOTE THAT I DIDN’T ASK FOR THE TIME/LOCATION AS THAT’S TOO MUCH INFORMATION IN THE FIRST EMAIL.]<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>-Samantha</blockquote><div><strong>How to ask for recommendations for people to talk to<br></strong><br></div><blockquote>Hello John,<br><br>Hope all is well.<br><br>If you recall, we spoke a few months ago when I was exploring new career opportunities in information security (I was your student at the time). Thanks again for agreeing to be my reference! [REMIND THE BUSY PERSON HOW YOU KNOW EACH OTHER<br><br>I was browsing the the Acme Career site the other day and the Research Scientist role caught my eye. I think it’d be perfect for me considering my work on insider threat-related projects at Current Company. [NOTE THAT THE FOCUS OF THIS EMAIL IS ASKING FOR RECOMMENDATIONS, NOT DIRECTLY ASKING FOR A JOB. JOHN UNDERSTANDS YOU’RE LOOKING FOR WORK AND DOESN’T WANT TO BE PUT ON THE SPOT. IF HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE POSITION, HE WILL.]<br><br>From what I remember, it sounds pretty similar to the work you do at Acme. By any chance, do you know of anyone there that you think I should chat with? I’d love to learn more about the role so I can see if it’s the right fit for me.<br><br>If not, no problem — just wanted to keep you in the loop. Thanks again for all your help!<br><br>Take care,<br>Roger</blockquote><div>You now have both the tactics (the email scripts) as well as a strategic approach (narrowing down your networking, focusing on helping others, and understanding the power dynamic).<br><br></div><div>All in one day.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div></div>
