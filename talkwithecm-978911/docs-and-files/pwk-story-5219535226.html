      <div>It all started with a pain.&nbsp;<br><br>I was sitting in a room with a group of moms, babies everywhere squirming and rolling around on the floor. We all had a common pain and showed up for a free session about the struggles of returning to the work world after a break. My little one was clearly older than the rest - already walking. Before the meeting started I wondered, am I in the right place?<br><br>That question, which seems innocent enough - was like a loud sounding gong in my brain. Am I in the right place?<br><br>After the birth of my child, I struggled to find the right place - where do I fit in? Where do I belong?<br><br>My pre-child connections and activities didn't stretch quite far enough to include a newborn. My professional trajectory crashed and suffered at the expense of breastfeeding. My mom groups essentially fall apart as soon as maternity leave ends. &nbsp;<br><br>It seems like we are expected to work as if we don't have children and parent as if we don't have work.&nbsp;<br><br>AND YET - I know that I'm not the only one. I know that there are other professionals out there, working &amp; parenting, trying to find the alchemists mix - the perfect harmony of professional and private life. But where are YOU?<br><br>So, I decided to find my tribe.&nbsp;<br><br>After sitting in that group &amp; listening to the burning questions and experiences of so many parents, I knew that I was not alone, but I didn't know where we could meet and connect.&nbsp;<br><br>I took my idea to Claudia, the then president of the Vienna Family Network (VFN). I knew that I needed to have at least 4 people to qualify as a special interest group, but other than that I felt like I was branching out into the great unknown.&nbsp;<br><br>How should I form my group? Where should our primary focus be? Would anyone respond?<br><br>I put out my first call on Facebook - Hello everyone!</div><div>I want to start a new VFN group - a VFN Professionals group. This group will focus on questions around the topic "How can I be seen as a professional and have a family at the same time?"&nbsp;<br><br>with the simple plan to create a sub-group on Facebook.&nbsp;<br><br>The response was overwhelming! comments &amp; emails flooded in.&nbsp;<br>countless - "Yes! -Interested! -Count me in!"&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you so much and thumbs up for making this happen!&nbsp;<br>- Elena&nbsp;<br>A few days later I had 80 requests for membership - 80! Imagine that, just a week before I was wondering if I could actually get 4 others to join me and qualify as a group.<br><br>I'll be honest, the first weeks were a complete rush! So many positive responses, YES! I want this and bringing their questions - the deep topics that don't have easy answers.&nbsp;<br><br></div><ol><li>I'm interested in sharing ideas on how to manage family and work (I work full time and have a 21 months old daughter), tips when looking for a new job, networking would be also great. - Petya</li><li>Meetups to exchange ideas and best practises would be great.<br><br>I am interested in topics of stay-at-home dad / part time / remote work / reliable childcare.<br>- Feri&nbsp;</li><li>How do you go about finding family friendly employment? At the moment it seems like as soon as I mention wanting to do 32 hours a week everyone drops me as a candidate. Are others facing the same? - Simona</li></ol><div>In less than a month in August 2018 - we had our first live meeting. A funny mix of professional conference, backyard bbq and VFN meetup - it was awesome!<br><br>I started with an introduction:&nbsp;<br>" Who is the VFN Professionals? We are for VFN members and by VFN members. We represent many nations, cultures and industries. We are freelancers, employees, CEOs, business owners and more. We are parents who want to make the best life that we can for our children.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We are the faces you see here tonight. "<br><br>and the first seeds were planted.&nbsp;<br><br>- monthly meeting with formal &amp; informal time, food / casual time</div><div>- meeting at different locations, highlighting different members &amp; VFN businesses<br><br>Things started strong, and members stepped up to get involved and support the group. We had freshly baked cake, a photography team, everything came together so well...until it didn't.&nbsp;<br><br>Expat Professionals with kids are some of the busiest people on this planet. travel for work, kindergarten cough, there were plenty of things working against us actually meeting up.&nbsp;<br><br>I remember one Specific meeting, back in June 2019 - I was really excited to see that 20+ people signed up for our June meeting - YIPPEE! I booked the location, prepared chairs, snacks, etc. but then we were only 8 people in total (including 2 small children).&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>I understand that plans change, people get sick (especially little ones) and I expect that, but a 70% drop-off is a bit more than I expected.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br><br>Fast forward two years later to January 2020<br>For the first time I was able to line up 3 speakers in a row, with a common theme. I felt that we were finally getting into a groove. We even felt ready, starting in April 2020 to take the next step and provide content online for members who were not able to join the live meetings.<br><br>Funny thing, the corona-virus pandemic had other plans, with a passion to meet people exactly where they are, I called on my resources and threw together a March webinar in less than a week. It was remarkable. The speakers were amazing, the crowd was so supportive.&nbsp;<br><br>I knew instantly that things were changing. We had reached a new level. Over the next months, we continued hosting monthly meetings covering topics important to us vis webinars:<br>march - professionals with kids - at home - 32 registrants&nbsp;<br>April - professional coaching - 36 registrants<br>may - Guidepost Montessori - 53 registrants&nbsp;<br><br>and using an online platform opens gifts us the opportunity to reach a broader scope of speakers - we are no longer limited to those physically in Vienna.&nbsp;<br><br>This opportunity excites me. We have the chance to bring great value to our members and expand our reach.&nbsp;<br><br>What has been clear from the beginning - not all VFN members are professionals, and not all professionals with kids are Vfn members. Yet, we are a valuable part of the VFN group.&nbsp;<br><br>As mentioned in many of our emails - we are deeply grateful for the VFN for giving us the platform to meet and grow together.&nbsp;<br><br>At this point, the group is expanding and growing with many requests from non-vfn members.&nbsp;<br>we stand at a point of decision, do we clip our wings and stay within the VFN or stretch and grow as opportunities arise?&nbsp;<br><br>As for me I choose growth. This is such an interesting point in history and the work we've done in this group is so important. I believe that the value we created will continue to grow as we welcome and share with others.&nbsp;<br><br>So it is with excitement that I announce the launch of our new independent group: Professionals With Kids, with the same values and goals we created as VFN Professionals.<br><br>So, what about the VFN? The VFN is our home, our birthplace, and we want to maintain a close connection there.&nbsp;<br><br>VFN Professionals will still continue - as it was before, and we will continue to add value and support for monthly webinars &amp; social meetings via Professionals With Kids.<br><br>So, what's the change? What's different? Not much, except we expect the webinars to have more participants, more speakers and topics that are of value to you, exclusive workshops and digital assets.<br><br></div><div>so, join us!<br><br><br></div><div></div>
