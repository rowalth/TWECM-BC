These are also two of the biggest obstacles to success and happiness</div><div><br>Some people feel more fear and self-doubt than others. And, some are better at overcoming these emotions than others.</div><div><br>Regardless of where you fall on the fear/self-doubt spectrum, there are many things you can do to rise above these emotions.</div><div><br></div><h1>Conquer your fear and self-doubt with this process:</h1><div><strong><br>1. Identify what you’re actually afraid of</strong></div><div><br>What do you really fear? Most of us don’t have to worry about being mauled by a tiger. Our lives are rarely in danger. The most common fears in a modern society are failure and making a fool out of one’s self. Of course, there are others.</div><div><br>If you want to start a business, but can’t seem to get started, what’s your real concern? Maybe you want to ask a coworker out on a date. What’s the real fear?</div><div><br>Be aware of your actual fear, and then you’ll have a chance of addressing it.</div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>2. Find situations related to your fear that are only mildly uncomfortable</strong></div><div><br>Perhaps you have a fear of public speaking. What could you do that’s similar, but less terrifying? You could: give a speech to a group of friends; start conversations with strangers; visualize yourself giving a speech; do more group activities and speak up more; if you’re afraid of heights, you could start by looking down over a second floor balcony and slowly work your way up to greater heights.</div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>3. Take action</strong></div><div><br>Thinking creates and magnifies fear. Taking action lessens fear. One of the best ways to get over fear is to immediately take action before you have a chance to talk yourself out of it.</div><blockquote>Most people would be more successful, happier, and less afraid if they thought less and did more.</blockquote><div><br></div><div><strong><br>4. Visualize yourself being unafraid</strong></div><div><br>Imagine you have a twin that’s similar to you, but different in other ways. If you could build the perfect twin, what would they be like? What skills, beliefs, and attitudes would they have? How would they handle the situation that creates fear in you? Allow yourself to become that twin.</div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>5. Give yourself small successes</strong></div><div><br>Set yourself up to win. Make the game so easy that you can’t fail. As you gain confidence, up the stakes a little. Get used to being successful in the situations that cause you to feel fear.</div><div><br>If the thought of making 100 cold calls a day makes you break out in a cold sweat, give yourself the goal of making just one cold call. The next day, you can do three.</div><div><br>Show yourself that you can do it. Show yourself that nothing bad is going to happen to you.</div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>6. Be realistic</strong></div><div><br>What’s the worst consequence you’re likely to endure if the thing you fear comes true? It’s probably not anything you can’t handle!</div><div><br>What happens if the publisher rejects your book? What if your speech doesn’t go well? What’s actually going to happen to you? Will you still be safe? Will your family still love you?</div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>7. Get help</strong></div><div><br>Whether you need some help from a friend or a professional, there’s no shame in getting help. You’d get help if your car’s engine blew up. You’d get help if you broke a leg. Get the help you need to deal with your fears.</div><div><br></div><div><br>How much do you allow fear and self-doubt to rule your life? Imagine what your life would be like if you could overcome all of your fears and self-doubt. Most people avoid the actions that trigger these uncomfortable feelings. You can do better. You can act in the face of these emotions and live your life to the fullest.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><ul><li><br></li></ul><div><br></div><div></div>

      <div>Conquering your inner critic&nbsp;<br><br>Hands up for any one who knows what an inner critic is - ME!&nbsp;<br><br>Fear, self doubt and even imposter syndrome are most of us will encounter at one time or another...but what do we do about it? Ahhh, that's the question.&nbsp;<br><br>Earlier this year I was contacted to be a guest on a podcast - pretty exciting, right?&nbsp;<br><br>Exciting and terrifying! While I've done lots of videos and interviews for others, this was my first time being a guest on someone else's show and I felt NERVOUS.&nbsp;<br><br>I was used to being the host and had gotten used to having everything under my control. Being a guest on someone else's show brought up all kinds of old memories of experiences from the past where I've been mis-quoted or even had my photo used inappropriately to raise interest and sell more papers.&nbsp;<br><br>"What if they ask a question I can't answer? Or they twist my words around so that I sound stupid or full of myself?"<br><br>"Ugg, with the pandemic and so many other things going on, I don't need any extra stress...I need a break."<br><br>It was exciting to be invited and scary at the same time - and I said YES.&nbsp;<br><br>Logically you would think that all of my previous experience would make this an easy YES.&nbsp;<br><br>I've made oodles of videos, hosted plenty of webinars and even interviewed quite a few experts.<br><br>But trying something new and unfamiliar can be a trigger and swipe away the confidence and security that we depend on.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Things that we are afraid of - might even know the phobia name for it...but for most people that's where the story ends, right? Or does it?&nbsp;<br><br>The truth is that our fears and self doubt can be holding us back and preventing us from doing the things and accomplishing the goals that most want &amp; for no reason other than we haven't done it yet.&nbsp;<br><br>1 - What is the fear?&nbsp;<br>trigger -&nbsp;<br>invisable messagees -&nbsp;<br><br>2 -&nbsp;</div>
