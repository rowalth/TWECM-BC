      <div><em>Note from Raelyn: This is a more subtle sales email. If you prefer to send a sales email that is more “indirect”, this plot twist email is what you need. The Plot Twist Email starts off with an excuse to email your list because something has changed - i.e. the “plot twist”. In this email, you don’t directly sell, but you indirectly mention your product / service and what’s happening with it. I call it the plot twist email because something has to change (aka a plot twist) that warrants an email to your list.</em><br><em>Here are some examples of plot twists you can use to email your list about... and bring your launch / promotional campaign back to the top of their minds!</em></div><div><br>●&nbsp; <em>I changed something in the course</em></div><div>●&nbsp; <em>I had to redo everything in the course</em></div><div>●&nbsp; <em>I had to redo certain chapters of the course</em></div><div>●&nbsp; <em>New bonus added</em></div><div>●&nbsp; <em>New training added</em></div><div>●&nbsp; <em>Training removed</em></div><div>●&nbsp; <em>Payment plan added<br></em><br></div><div><strong>Subject Line: [Describe the Plot Twist Here - e.g. I Redid 2 Modules of [Course Name]...] Email Copy:<br></strong>Hey [first name]!<br>How have you been?<br><br></div><div>I have been working tirelessly for the last few days because I...

Others may be hesitant to pay a huge sum of money up-front (even if they have the cash) and this payment plan will increase the number of students who choose to take you up on your offer. You can also choose to send this email after the cart has closed, giving people who have missed your promotion another chance to buy. Personally, I don’t send this email, but students who have done so have reported amazing results.</em></div><div><strong><br>Subject Line: New Payment Plan Added!<br></strong><br></div><div><strong>Email Copy:<br></strong><br></div><div>Did you want to enroll in [Course Name] but can’t afford to right now?<br><br></div><div>I have heard you, [first name]!<br><br></div><div>We’ve added a new payment plan for [Course Name].
