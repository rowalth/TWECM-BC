Conversation vs. lecture, even in a lecture, I encourage you to <strong>Interact with your audience - </strong>This helps make the presentation more engaging, holds the audience’s attention, and increases the amount of information they take away from your talk.<ul><li>This could mean Including pauses in your presentation,&nbsp;</li><li>asking and encouraging people to ask for questions, if they need clarification on any of the presentation.&nbsp;</li><li>You can also address people in the audience directly, either by name or by simply looking them in the eye.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li># people - 1:1 - small group - large group , taking a moment to think about the shifting dynamics in advance helps you to ease into the transition</li><li>Open vs. closed bubble , TV interview, panel discussion, small group, think about body language as we discussed in Module 1.</li><li>A few tips about how to be the centre of conversation &amp; how to pass the spotlight to someone else - eye contact &amp; body language again play a huge roll here. Note where your body language says that your attention is going, and what about others around you? with a question / making a comment - pass question / introduction</li></ul></li><li>time - Think about adjusting your message to different time allotments<ul><li>This is an easy one to prepare and practice in advance</li><li>the only thing you need is a timer :)</li><li>Time adjustments (10-30 seconds, 5 - 40 min)<ul><li>10 second introduction</li><li>30 pitch</li><li>5 minute interview, a 40 min presentation or a 5 day workshop</li></ul></li><li>The 30 seconds that could change your life</li></ul></li><li>tools - there is not ONE answer that is right for every situation, but taking a few moments to think ahead will ensure that you feel confidence with the right tools when it really matters.&nbsp;<ul><li>Communication aids? business cards/ppt/CV</li><li>medium (live/ppt/digital)</li><li>Which communication tools &amp; when?&nbsp;<ul><li>PPT -&nbsp;<ul><li>Put together a simple slideshow. Use the slideshow as a way to emphasize key points, not to explain them in detail. Otherwise you risk that your audience will just look at the slides instead of paying attention to what you are saying.<ul><li>Use only a small amount of text or visual material per slide. For instance, if you are outlining three goals for your organization’s upcoming year, make a slide that says “Goal 1: Boost membership 10%.”</li><li>That is enough information to remind the audience of the point you want to make, but not so much that they will stop paying attention.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>printed materials - business cards, brochures, networking outreach plan CV, etc.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>WEEK 3 TASKS:</strong></div><ul><li>30 Second Pitch Worksheets - with step by step instructions to create your pitch (including no fail messaging techniques)</li><li>Post - feedback for at least 2 other members in the group (using framework)</li><li>Sounding Board - share your target message with someone else LIVE (in the group)</li></ul><div><br><br></div><h1>Dream BIG</h1><div><strong><br>Week 4 - online course:</strong><br><br>Video 1:<br>This module is a bit different than the 3 modules that we've had so far. <br>This is what I like to call our master's round - an extra module to go back and <br>+rework any material that needs more time<br>+dig deeper <br>+ get more practice <br>+ challenge yourself<br><br>You probably also noticed that we completed the 9 step blueprint in the last module...so this is a bonus module to gather everything we've talked about together and push you to dream BIG and realize what IS within your reach!<br><br>This module does not have step by step lessons, like the previous modules, but rather individual challenges.<br>+challenge menu - you can do all the them, or pick and chose <br><br>I suggest that you do the weekly challenge as well as at least one other challenge. <br>It's up to you - but the more challenges you take on in this module, the more rewards you'll gain - guaranteed!<br><br>Let's start with the weekly challenge - that's for everyone!<br><br><strong>Weekly challenge :</strong> bring your pain points - where are you struggling with your message? Which parts are most difficult for you and where would you like some support? Let us know.<br><br>The 5 other challenges are:<br><br><strong>Level up Challenge</strong> - where it is all about making clear goals to get out of your comfort zone and make continual progress, no matter where you are in your journey. <br><br><strong>Feelings Challenge </strong>- this is all about focusing on the feelings of others and completely changing the way you interact with others.<br><br><strong>Embrace the struggle Challenge </strong>- What percentage of your story is about struggle? 10 -20 -75%? Do you brush over and jump to the conclusion too soon? This challenge will help you be mindful &amp; get exactly the right balance. <br><br><strong>Adding Value Challenge </strong>- In this challenge we get really specific about how to add value in any situation, with special tips for introverts!<br><br><strong>No, you don't understand, I STILL don't know what to say - Notebook Challenge </strong>Ok, I've given you a few simple scripts...but maybe they were just too simple for what you need. So, now I want to give you a complete system to know how to talk with confidence and know exactly what to say in any social situation. <br><br>I suggest that you do the weekly challenge as well as at least one other challenge. <br>It's up to you - but the more challenges you take on in this module, the more rewards you'll gain - guaranteed!<br><br><br><br><strong>A. level up challenge: <br></strong>&nbsp;where it is all about making clear goals to get out of your comfort zone and make continual progress, no matter where you are in your journey. <br>story Beth - shy, but wanted to reach out and break out of her comfort zone. <br>Joined a local group - Professional Women's Network<br>talk to 3 people - &gt; volunteer - &gt; greeter (talking to everyone!)<br>talk to speaker - &gt; connecting, right at the start -&gt; made the rest of the night easier<br><br><strong>B. set your intention / feeling of others challenge:<br></strong>maya Anglo - <br>my teacher - from the module<br>my trip to the danube river - <br>story - swimming in the water with my daughter...<br><br><br><strong>C. embrace the struggle challenge:</strong> what percentage of your story is about struggle? 10? 20? 75? Be mindful &amp; strive to get the balance right. Hint - you probably need to show more struggle. <br>My story of learning chinese<br>- sitting through the first class - 3 hours long -, staring - NO IDEA<br> - thought I was in the wrong class, nope<br>-for a moment, I even considered quitting - how was I going to do this??...nope! <br>+refocus on my goals, develop a plan<br>-reached out to the office, finding resources<br>-getting a tutor<br>-hours making sounds in front of a mirror<br>-listening to audio recordings day &amp; night<br>+started to sink in, but I knew that I was one of the worst in the class<br>-went out for the drama competition<br>-memorised my lines<br>-practiced with different ways -adding a bit of drama!<br>?what are we going to do?? (3x)<br>+ our skit didn't win any prizes...but I did win the best pronunciation award! (not because I have the best pronunciation, but because I improved so much - and shocked the judges!<br>+I was one of the first westerners to earn a merit based scholarship - especially after only 3 months.<br>+story of when I registered, they didn't even take me seriously.<br><br>One of the founding members of this course worked on a story about her experience living in Vienna. She hated when people asked her 'so, you don't have a job? what do you do?' by the end of the course she created a powerful story of her journey, accomplishments and learnings from her experience living in Vienna for two years. She was then able to take this story to job interviews too!<br><br><strong>D. adding value </strong>- showing leadership in a social group! - making decisions, guidance / not dominance!&nbsp;<br>doesn't matter who the others are (superiors, guests, strangers, friends) this works in almost every situation, and people, especially busy people, appreciate it!<br><br>So, let me give you three scripts that you can use — make them your own — to become a leader by offering specific suggestions and recommendations:<br><br></div><ul><li>“Oh, there’s a nice coffee shop around the corner. How about we go there?”</li><li>“There is a new lunch place that opened in the first district, I heard it is really good.”</li><li>“Let’s sit over here, it’s quieter.”</li></ul><div><br>Notice how each of these scripts are gentle, delicate, and also position you as a leader.&nbsp;<br><br>That is the power of being a leader. You don’t have to flex your muscles all the time, but you can simply make suggestions knowing that it's adding value, so other people don’t have to think.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><br>Introvert special:<br>We can all think of leaders who are very strong, we can also think of leaders who are very loud, we can also think of leaders who are very quiet and lead in their own way. <br><strong>Again, leading is not about being pushy or being the loudest person in the room. Leading is about taking responsibility for offering choices to people and for bringing out the best in yourself and in others.)</strong><br>Rosa Parks - gentle, not loud / demanding, she was selected to lead the movement for equal rights <br>two stories from my own personal experience:<br>#1 - Living in Taiwan, I had money sent my western union...I left work early, arranged a substitute, etc. the bank was open...but the western union person was NOT there - and it was Friday! So, no money until Monday, at the earliest. <br>+I got loud<br>+I demanded<br>+I told them to find a solution<br>+wouldn't take no for an answer...<br>until, I did.<br><br>#2<br><br><br><strong>E. No, you don't understand, I STILL don't know what to say - Notebook Challenge</strong><br>Ok, I've given you a few simple scripts...but they were just too simple. So, now I want to give you a complete system to know how to talk with confidence and know exactly what to say in any social situation.&nbsp; 3 parts:<br>1 - words - watch for action / reaction: Here's how it works -I want you to use the three phrases simple opening phrases...greetings every day for seven days on different strangers. +story from Drehm! It can be your Amazon Prime delivery guy, your barista, the checkout lady at the grocery store, whoever!<br>-smile (developing smile - spreads across your face), slow down, change your energy level<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>They’re called social “skills,” </strong>and like any skill, you can get <em>better </em>at them. We’re starting small on purpose. As you get more used to it, you can start to scale and open conversations with more people.</li><li><strong>Most people you talk to are bored all day long. </strong>This means you’ll be doing them a favor by engaging with them just like my friend was with the cashier at the coffee shop.</li><li><strong>Note their reactions and your reactions. </strong>Did the person you’re talking to start smiling and laughing because of your energy? Or did they retreat because you made them uncomfortable? How did you feel while you were smiling or talking slowly?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><div><br><br></div><div>As you use the phrases though, keep in mind the different ways you can change up how you deliver your words (smiling, slowing down, and changing your tone).</div><div><br>2 -message (more stories!!)
