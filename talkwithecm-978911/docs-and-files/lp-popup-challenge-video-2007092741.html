      <h1>ROMAN-<br>Have you ever wondered how to make instant connections to people in a crowd, or how to talk to ANYONE without feeling awkward or fake. I'm Elizabeth from talkwithecm and we have something for you. We are trying something completely different - we doing a PopUp event to give you challenges where you can learn all of these things, push the boundaries of your reach, have some fun, and it takes less than 2 hours.<br>Be part of it<br>Join us!</h1><div><br></div><h1>LP - video</h1><h1>PopUp Challenge Event - right in the heart of Vienna.<br><br>Hi, Elizabeth here &amp; it is time for our PopUp Challenge event - where we meet each other, face to face and get real about changing the way you communicate.</h1><h1>Listen, have you ever avoided approaching new people because you don’t know what to say? Or maybe you groan every time you hear the question “So, what do you do?” Perhaps you try to make a joke or just bumble around feeling awkward because you're not sure how to answer without coming across as salesy, fake, or over the top technical and ultimately boring the other person to death.<br><br>I know so many people who struggle with this exact situation! Wouldn’t it be great to somehow jump past all of those awkward first getting to know you moments? Imagine being able to talk freely as if you already know each other well, and you:<ul><li>And can talk freely, without worrying about making a good impression</li><li>you can connect on a deeper level</li><li>have built up trust and</li><li>already like and understand each other well</li></ul></h1><h1>Sounds great, right?<br><br>The truth is that you can! Now I’m not talking about any hocus-pocus or avoiding first meetings and introductions.

Because meeting new people and building relationships is key to building your network, accelerating your career and enriching your social life, but it doesn’t have to be awkward.<br><br>You know, when I first started my business, I was so eager to tell others about it. Yet, I felt really frustrated every time I noticed that people just didn’t get it, gave me a blank stare and said, “oh, um, nice. interesting.” I realized pretty quickly that I could either keep going and just hope that someone would eventually get it, or I needed to find a way to connect with others authentically - fast.&nbsp;<br><br>For me the decision was pretty clear, because I already know the deep impact of a great first impression. That is exactly why I want to share this valuable information with you.&nbsp;<br><br>If you fumble around with your words, or can’t introduce yourself in a simple way, you are probably missing out on some great connections and letting opportunities pass you by!&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Whether you want to build strong connections to advance your career, make a solid first impression at an upcoming interview, or you want to have engaging conversations at your next social event, you really should to come to this event.<br><br>So sign up today and join us at our PopUp Challenge Event - right here in the heart of Vienna!</h1><div><br><br></div><h1><br></h1><h1>Introduce yourself without feeling <em>awkward</em> or fake</h1><div>“ how to speak about who I am and what I do without feeling small the skill to never feel akward, to always stay authentical and never play a role (or at least at most times...)”</div><div><br><br></div><div>Do you avoid approaching new people because you don’t know what to say?

We all know that in today’s market it is all about standing out.</div><div><br></div><div>Whether you want to make a solid first impression in an interview, at a networking event or during a social event, you need to have it together.</div><div><br></div><div>So now here’s my recipe to introduce yourself without being awkward or weird</div><div><br></div><div><br>1. Be approachable<br><br></div><div>The more approachable you are, the easier it will be for others to talk to you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Dress for confidence! If you are going to a networking meeting, wear something that makes YOU feel good. It is much easier to come across as a professional if you look and feel professional. And don’t hold yourself back - I often encourage people to add something unique or special that shows off your personality. This could be a special pin, bag, crazy socks, whatever. A friend of mine loves to wear ties that he designed - super cool &amp; a great talking point!</li><li>Whatever you do, focus on feeling good, confident and open because - and this is key - when you feel comfortable, people are naturally drawn to you (without even knowing why!)</li><li>Now let’s talk about some good open body language practices</li></ul><ol><li>Think about eye contact - glance around the room when you enter. This is a great practice for so many reasons - from personal safety issues, to strategic planning, to making yourself more approachable.</li><li>Think about your posture - maintain open arms and open posture or direct everything to what you are interested in.</li><li>This last one is something almost no one talks about, relax your mouth and jaw. Tight scrunched up lips, clenched jaw or a frown all spell trouble when meeting new people, whether you do it intentionally or not. If you’re not a smiley person, that’s fine. No smiles required :) just keep&nbsp;<br><br></li></ol><div>Here are a few extra things to keep in mind when meeting people. NO ONE likes being rejected! So whether you’re approaching someone or they’re approaching you, make it as safe and easy as possible. Be kind to each other.</div><div><br><br><br></div><div>2. Start talking:</div><div>Generally people don’t start right out with their full 30 second pitch, “Hi, I’m Emma, I help busy women eat healthier to lose weight, get more energy, and thrive in their body and life. - blink, blink. Ok</div><div><br></div><div>When first meeting someone it is best to start simple -&nbsp;</div><div>“Hi, how are you?”</div><div>“I'm Elizabeth..and you are?”</div><div>And then it helps to know a few easy conversation starters, so you are never at a loss for words. I like to use questions that help draw other people out.&nbsp;</div><ul><li>What's your story? This is a great open ended question that gives the other person a lot of space to answer how they want.&nbsp;</li><li>How / Why questions - These are often referred to as open-ended questions, which simply means that you can’t give a short one word answer. They are perfect for getting a conversation started.&nbsp;</li><li>An added bonus of having a few great questions prepared is that when you ask interesting questions &amp; people think YOU are interesting, but the converse is true as well, when you ask boring or limited questions...right - you come across as boring as well.&nbsp;</li><li>Tell me more about that! (magic words!)<br><br></li></ul><div><br></div><div>3. Pay attention to BODY LANGUAGE</div><div>Here are a few tips to say, I'm listening or I’m interested without saying a word:</div><ul><li><br>hold eye contact with someone one second longer than you normally would</li><li>React to meeting someone or hearing something:<ul><li>growing smile</li><li>lift eyebrows (lightning fast!) - WOW! That’s great.</li><li>slight nod / head tilt (This must be SUPER SUBTLE!! Otherwise you risk looking like one of those bobble head dolls)</li><li>turn your whole body towards the person you are speaking with - toes / legs / core / face / eyes</li></ul></li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li><br>get closer&nbsp;<ul><li>Here I’m talking about a very slight lean in or a small-small step closer.</li><li>Closing the distance between you and the person who is talking helps build a connection between you. Be careful with this one, it must be subtle or it will completely steal the focus away from what is being said. Additionally getting too close can just be creepy or send a more sexual message, intended or not. &nbsp;<br><br></li></ul></li></ul><div>These are all signals you can send and watch for in others.</div><div><br></div><div>These signals are so basic they are often looked over. Often people do these things without even thinking about it...and they are super obvious to sensitive people. Now, I'm not suggesting that you FAKE signals, but rather be aware of what you are doing and not doing -think about it and be intentional about what signals you are sending.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A great example of this in action having dental work done...usually people who don't feel comfortable with their smile, for whatever reason, hold back, close their lips, cover their mouth, or just&nbsp; DON'T smile much. Then once the dental work is complete - boom! They are like a whole new person- happier, friendlier, more confident, all of this because they feel more comfortable with their smile!&nbsp; Don't believe me, ask anyone who's had braces!</div><div><br></div><div>Now before we close, I want to say a few words about business introductions.</div><div>Or more specifically, how to answer that dreaded question, "So, tell me, what do you do?" I’ve created a simple 4 part recipe to introduce yourself without feeling awkward. I call it my Super Savvy Introduction.</div><div><br></div><div>1) I'm a _______________&nbsp;</div><div>(what you do / job title or general description)</div><div><br></div><div>2) and I work with____________________________</div><div>(<em>who you support / boss or customers</em>)</div><div><br></div><div>3) helping them_________________________________</div><div>(<em>the big picture of what you do</em>)</div><div><br></div><div>4) so that they can __________________________</div><div><em>(the results you make possible</em><strong><em>)</em></strong></div><div><br></div><div>Try to keep it authentic and conversational – get rid of anything too salesy or that just doesn’t feel like you. The goal here is to be authentic - people are asking about YOU!</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Here are some examples to help you create your own:</strong></div><div><br></div><div><em>I’m a Marketing Strategist and I work with CEOs in large pharmaceutical corporations helping them create key links between Marketing and Sales departments, so that they can dramatically increase engagement with their clients and sell more products.&nbsp;</em></div><div><br></div><div><em>I’m a fluency coach and I work with top performing professionals helping them speak more confidently and clearly and overcome the fears that have held them back for years, so that they can make connections, build relationships and unlock the tools to accelerate their career.&nbsp;</em></div><div><br><br></div><div></div>
