      <div><strong>&nbsp;How to instantly connect with your audience and compel them to take action without sounding like a sleazy used car salesperson <br><br></strong>At talkwithecm, I empower busy professionals to use English more confidently and expand opportunities for work, networking &amp; more. I can show you how to break the curse of "not enough" and the myth of "hard work pays off," because I know, without question, that you can attract the kinds of connections you want, move beyond meaningless small talk and impact millions (even if you've been struggling for years). Let's talk about how you can flip the switch in your thinking, dump old-school rules down the toilet and stay true to what lights you up &amp; energizesyou!<strong><br><br></strong>Sitting in business school, I'll never forget when my two worlds collided - my love of maths &amp; science and my passion for arts &amp; humanities. <br><br>Business Development 101: What is the most memorable kind of communication? A good old-fashioned story, of course! Throughout history and even today, a good story is the most effective way to connect the mind to the soul. <br><br>The <strong>art</strong> of storytelling is a cherished tradition and an entertaining and effective way to convey information about almost any subject. <br><br>The <strong>science</strong> of storytelling transforms a dry list of facts into something memorable and can even compel others to take action. <br><br>And just like that everything that I had learned up until that point came crashing together in one great epiphany - <strong>The Power of Storytelling.</strong><br><br>Listen in on any classroom and you'll find teachers educating their students with stories. Watch interactions in a major corporations around the world and you'll find high profile CEOs expressing thoughts, opinions, and facts to their employees with stories. Politicians include stories in their speeches to create more emotional connection with their audience. Wherever you go, storytelling is a powerful means of communication. <br><br>Great brands understand that as humans we are hardwired for stories and use storytelling to connect, engage, and move listeners on an emotional level… to tears, to laughter, to anger, to sympathy, to action. <br><br><em>“Storytelling is one of the most powerful ways to breathe life into your brand and is also one of the main components of a solid content marketing approach.” ~ David Campbell, Right Inbox</em><br><br><strong>Why Should We Tell Stories? </strong>Scientific studies have proven again and again that each of us has a desire, even a need, to tell and hear stories. By sharing our stories with others, and indulging in their stories, we learn to understand one another at a much deeper level. By creating a common level of understanding, we come together as a community of individuals – appreciating both the differences and similarities we share. It is possible to convey your thoughts, feelings, and experiences through stories. By doing so, you're verbally expressing the things you value, the customs you take part in, and the wisdom you've acquired in life. Have you ever felt that you didn't have anything interesting to share? Have you ever wished that you could grip audiences with the power of a good story?&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>If so, you'll be happy to know that there are <strong><em>many</em></strong><em> </em>stories within you, just waiting to be told! And by becoming a more effective storyteller, you can overcome feelings of isolation and develop a stronger connections with others. <br><br><em>“Storytelling, when done right, will pull a consumer into the world of a brand to see a different perspective, showing them the bigger picture. The story is an invitation for someone to participate in something bigger than themselves, something they believe in.” Joe Teo, Hey Orca<br></em><br></div><div><strong>4 Elements of Becoming a Great Storyteller&nbsp;</strong></div><div>Even if you've <strong>NEVER</strong> told a story in your life, you <strong><em>can</em></strong><em> </em>become a great storyteller! With a little effort and practice, your storytelling skills will improve and people will be drawn to what you have to say.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Here are 4 key elements for telling great stories:&nbsp;</div><div><strong>1. Ensure that your presence is prominent. </strong>You must have the attention of your audience, whether it's a small group of friends or a large crowd. The goal here is to captivate your audience so they want to hear more. In order to do so, you'll want speak clearly and deliberately with an upright posture and confident demeanor. There's nothing more annoying than only hearing parts of a good story.&nbsp;</div><div><strong>• </strong>Self-confidence plays a large role in making your presence prominent in a room. Take the time to remember WHY you are telling your story, the value you are bringing to others and the reasons why they will thank you after you finish. People do want to hear what you have to say.</div><div><br><strong>2. Connect with and engage your audience. </strong>Connecting with your audience on an emotional level is important. When you're able to authentically connect with others, you'll draw in the interest of the crowd and your story won't fall on deaf ears. This means understanding <em>who </em>they are, <em>what </em>they desire, <em>why </em>they're there, and <em>how </em>to speak to them. Once a deep connection is established, telling a good story gets easier and sometimes I have even found that the audience actually helps GROW the story!</div><div><strong>• </strong>Be mindful to talk and relate to your audience on an equal level. Timid voices and condescending tones can push people away. You shouldn't let your ego take over and talk down to people, nor should you let wavering self-confidence make you timid. We're all human with the desire to be understood and connect, so eliminate any negative perceptions or mental barriers from your mind.&nbsp;</div><div><strong>• </strong>Match how you speak with whom you're speaking to. Your tone, language, and attire should be different when you're talking to a kindergarten group versus a group of women over 30. Try to precisely understand what the audience goes through day-in and day-out and shape your story to match their experiences.&nbsp;</div><div><br><strong>3. Interact with your audience. </strong>Audience involvement is a simple technique to draw people in and help them feel involved in your story. You can ask questions, set up activities, or even welcome others share their experiences. This keeps your audience tuned in because they actually become part of the story.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>• </strong>Humor is another technique that can help you engage and interact with an audience and create more relatability but don't force it. Forcing humor into a story where it doesn't belong is awkward for both the storyteller and the audience.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>4. Offer value. </strong>When listening to your story, your audience wants to gain something, ideally they are looking for edutainment. That is a bit of education in an entertaining way. Most people don't want to simply learn about you; usually they want to learn something of value from your experience that they can apply in their own lives. Structuring your story in a way to present a clear situation or problem that people can relate to and a solution or moral, provides a much deeper meaning and value that the audience can identify with.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>When you gain the full attention of your audience, you have the ability to connect with them on an emotional level and interact with them authentically, that way you can more closely identify with their personal situations and leave them on the edge of their seats waiting to hear more. The truth is that you have value to offer and stories to share - all it takes is a bit of training to master the art and science of storytelling.&nbsp;<br><br>How Do You Know If You Have a Branding Problem?<br>The Problem</div><div>1. Your message is confusing.<br>You have the best company, product or service, but your messaging isn’t resonating with your target customers.</div><div><br>2. You’ve been pigeonholed.<br>You're losing opportunities because your customers don't know the full scope of what you do and the value you can deliver.</div><div><br>3. You're competing on price.<br>You find yourself lowering your fees just to win business, instead of competing on value that typically commands premium pricing.</div><div><br>4.You look outdated.<br>Your customers view you as a dinosaur in your industry, because you give off the impression that you're not relevant or up-to-date.</div><div><br>5. Your marketing doesn't convert.<br>You’re wasting unnecessary time, money and energy on your marketing efforts just to acquire a customer.<br><br></div><h1>The FIX</h1><div>The bad news: No funnel, no strategy, no sales video, no ad strategy, nothing is going to make a bad message effective!<br><br>What is your core message?<br>Branding is the heart / soul / mind of your offer<br>Who you are &amp; what you value - consistently - let others get to know you &amp; feel comfortable instantly <br><br><strong>5 pillars of a great brand:</strong><br>1. Purpose<br>Your Brand Purpose is associated with your identity as a company. It describes the aspirational values by which you live life and do business every day. It answers the question, “Why does this brand exist?” When your brand purpose describes who you are and why you do what you do, it inspires your customer to connect with you. Because they resonate with you, more of your ideal clients come looking for you.</div><div><br>2. Positioning<br>Your Brand Positioning is the space you occupy (or intend to occupy) in the minds of your target customer. You can find your best brand position by identifying two critical components of your market that can be plotted on a chart. When you plot this out on a chart and insert your competitors, you’ll be able to identify a market that is not being fully served yet. That’s the open hole in your market!</div><div><br>3. Promise<br>Your Brand Promise is the ultimate benefit your customers receive when they buy your products or services. First, look within your company to make sure your promise is credible. Next, look at your customers and make sure your promise is relevant to them. Finally, look at your competitors to make sure your brand is unique compared to everyone else. When you can nail all three components, you have a powerful Brand Promise!</div><div><br>4. Product<br>Your product or service must be unique, easily recognizable, and distinct from everyone else’s in the market. It must be relevant to solving a core problem from which your target customer suffers. Its features benefit your customer, and it makes a difference in their lives. Communicate its purpose with an authentic name that evokes emotion, is easy to remember, and tells a story.</div><div><br>5. Personality<br>When your customer makes a purchase, they do so based primarily on an emotional connection with your brand personality. Is your brand funny? Nurturing? Adventurous? Rebellious? How does your customer perceive your brand personality? Your brand personality can become a key differentiator between you and your competition.</div><div><br></div><h1>5 Benefits:</h1><div>4. <strong>Customer recognition.</strong> Having a strong brand works to build customer recognition. This means when a customer is shopping for a particular product or considering a company to perform a service, they recognize your company in the running. Consumers are far more likely to choose a brand that they recognize over something unfamiliar, even if they don’t know a great deal about your company at the time.<br>5. <strong>Competitive edge in the market.</strong> Your brand is what differentiates you in the marketplace. When customers recognize and back your brand, it helps lend a competitive edge to your company. The more recognition you receive and the more you build your brand, the more you will find that your brand elevates and is competitive with other well-known brands.<br>6. <strong>Easy introduction of new products.</strong> When you already have a strong brand and loyal customers, it is often easier and less expensive to introduce new products or test them out before you further invest in them. If you have a loyal brand following, your customers will often be interested in your new products and even anticipate them being released.<br>7. <strong>Customer loyalty and shared values.</strong> The recognition and elevation that a strong brand builds upon all lend to greater customer loyalty. Customers are attracted to brands that they share values with. When you build a strong brand, you need to convey these values to build an emotional connection with customers. Brand loyalty often lasts a lifetime and even transfers to future generations.<br>8. <strong>Enhanced credibility and ease of purchase.</strong> Having a strong, well-known brand enhances your credibility with customers, your industry, and the marketplace as a whole. As you build your credibility, you also build recognition, loyalty, and competitiveness. Everything goes hand-in-hand, and you’ll find that your credibility has a direct connection to customers ease of purchase. We want to buy from companies we like, know, and trust. If your brand is credible, you’re far more likely to get the sale.</div><div><br></div><h1>Bonus invisible scripts buster</h1><div>Today, I would like to share some of the biggest misconceptions of going LIVE that I have seen and experienced myself. These are negative made-up stories we tell ourselves that are usually not true.&nbsp;</div><div><br>These aren’t tiny things that don’t matter in the grand scheme of things... I’m talking about thoughts or even full scripts that we might easily brush aside or even ignore in the moment, but actually have the power to hold us back and prevent us from finally living the life we want.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Interested to hear about them? Read on!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>SCRIPT #1 - Meh, that's not for me.</strong></div><div><br>I hear this all the time! A HUGE misconception that people have, especially professionals, is thinking that creating live videos is just for young people, super savvy Gen Z, and Millennials.&nbsp; Let me tell you that using a personal touch to connect with people online is NOT just for Instagram stars, tech geeks and TikTok heroes. It is a powerful tool that can be used by anyone - in fact, it becomes even more powerful when seen in a place you don't expect. Let me give you an example - imagine how you would feel opening a message from your boss / supervisor or the head of a company that you're interested in and suddenly you see a personalised video!<br>"Hi there. Just wanted to let you know that I'm thinking of you. I know that things have been a bit stressful this past week. So, I want to reach out to you live with this video.<br>Looking forward to connecting with you next week."<br><br>BOOM! Big deal - right? And you can make this kind of an impact too!<strong><br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>SCRIPT #2 - Sure, sounds great, but I can't now.<br></strong><br>This is another big one, right? How many times have we said that in the past? SO MANY! Yet, time keeps on going and opportunities for change just pass on by.&nbsp; The funny thing is that as humans we consistently OVERestimate what we can accomplish in a day and UNDERestimate what we can actually accomplish in a year.&nbsp;<br><br>Want an example? Think about new year's resolutions - exercise more, get healthy, spend more time with my kids...totally underestimated what is possible with an entire YEAR! If we were to actually sit down and calculate 365 days or 52 weeks...that opens up a lot more possibilities.&nbsp;</div><ul><li>run 365 miles / try 52 new recipes</li><li>create 365 social media posts / 52 live videos</li></ul><div>See how this works?<br><br>And, I always like to turn this around and ask myself:<br>A year from now, what will you wish you had started today?<br><br>BOOM! Big deal - right?</div><div><strong><br>SCRIPT #3 - That sounds fine, but no one is going digital in my industry<br></strong><br></div><div>Right. It is not easy to be first. I get that. Let me tell you about one of my clients. She loves to travel and was teaching English to support her passion. Following the standard school calendar, she scheduled her travels during the summer and holiday breaks.&nbsp;<br><br>After working together, she was able to shift most of her work online which opened so many more possibilities to create her dream life:</div><ul><li>year round travel - online classroom</li><li>more free time - automation</li><li>keep the personal touch that her students love - personalised mini videos</li><li>reach more clients - expanded digital reach</li></ul><div>Sounds like a dream, doesn't it?&nbsp;<br>The best part is that she didn't have to change her field or gain more skills. She just needed a clear system to match what she was already doing offline.&nbsp;</div><div><br><strong>SCRIPT #4 - Some people are just better at doing live videos than others, besides my presentation skills are fine.<br><br></strong>That's probably true.<strong> </strong>Of course each person is born with different traits and natural talents, but most skills - including communication and presentation skills - CAN be learned.<br><br>The real key to success that most people don't talk about is relationships. Your ability to connect with people is the single greatest competitive advantage that you can get, and this is even more true now in the time of physical distancing. The good news is that the ability to connect and form stronger relationships can be learned.</div><div><br></div><div></div>
