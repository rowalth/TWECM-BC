      <div>UGG! But Elizabeth, why is this so hard?<br><br>This is a question I hear a lot - whether your writing an email, creating copy for your website or making a post for social media, what you write matters, and you want to hit that sweet spot between 'OMG! I love this' &amp; 'I feel like she's talking directly to me!'<br><br>That's what Verbal Branding about, knowing exactly WHAT to say and WHEN to say it, so that you can attract the right kind of attention, connect in a meaningful way and inspire action. Here's how you know if your Verbal Branding is working for you:<br><br></div><ul><li>Attention: Attracting the right kind of attention is key! Attract the wrong kind of attention &amp; you'll be spending the next days/ weeks/ months balancing your time between trying to rebuild your reputation and filtering out trolls and annoying mis-matches. On the other hand, when you attract the right attention - from the exact people who need and want to connect with you - you'll be joyfully ticking off the YES box and filling your calendar for months to come.</li><li>Connection: Connection is something that we all long for, especially after the confusing times of social distancing and political mayhem. I can remember a time when people could meet, talk, laugh and build relationships that matter - professional connections and mentoring relationships that can give you a leg up, boost your career &amp; even build your business. I say it's time that we start having those kinds of conversations again!</li><li>Action: Inspiring action - that's what it's all about isn't it? When you write something, there is something you want or some action you what the reader to take - click the like /share button, make a purchase or schedule an appointment - whatever it is, your words need to be clear and inspiring enough to trigger a great big YES from your reader...otherwise you'll just hear crickets.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br><br>6 reasons why writing without solid Verbal Branding is hard:<br>1. This is new: It's all about finding the balance between science and art with a sprinkle of magic tossed in...When/where should you have learned this before? Unless you are a professional copy writer or have worked within the advertising industry for years, I guess you've never been taught these skills before. Sure, you've read oodles of emails, seen enough websites and ads to make your eyes bleed, and you might even feel quite knowledgable about what is good, but that isn't the same thing as creating copy... Especially not if you're looking to create something that that reflects your brand and inspires others! Think about it this way, just because I read 10 award winning books during our high school summer reading program doesn't mean I could write 10 great books - or even one single lousy one! - that summer.<br>2. It's a jungle out there - As mentioned in the last point, there really are plenty of examples of writing out there, good / bad / ugly....mostly ugly, if we're being honest...and the truth is that if it's good - really good - you'll be instantly transported away from the words, instead you'll start connecting on an emotional level, ...&amp; forget about your plan to study their writing patterns anyway. <br>3. You need a few key mindset shifts - getting into the right mindset to write, it's not about you, it's about your reader...who do you want to read this, how do you want them to feel, what actions do you want to inspire them to take<br>4. You're not sure where to start and then what comes next? Wouldn't it be so much easier with simple &amp; clear guidance (what to say &amp; how to say it) specific frameworks / guidance / questions - what information goes where &amp; how, so that you can stop beating your head against the computer screen and simply focus on what makes your brand brilliant!<br>5. The learning curve - I'm going to drop a great, big, stinky truth bomb here, it takes practice. Each time you hit publish, it's all about learning as you go, tweaking your words and tone over time so that you can create the magic to transport people away from the text and connect on a personal level &amp; grow your network. Verbal Branding doesn't offer you<em> instant</em> magic, but it does have that special spark...Besides, without a clear idea of where you're going, what your brand is all about, each email and post can feel like a random shot into the deep, dark abyss just hoping something might work.&nbsp;<br>6. Clear feedback - If you're anything like me, you're looking for feedback. Maybe you've even asked a friend or two for help, but besides a few opinions here and there... it can feel impossible to get the clear insight you want. Like an expert who's on your side, ready to review your work and give guidance about what's there, how it sounds, how it feels &amp; most importantly - what's missing!<br><br><br>Wether you're writing an email, creating a video or revamping your website - Verbal Branding is your key to writing copy that inspires others to stand up and say YES!<br><br>Now that it is clear what you want (Verbal Branding) and how to develop it (Simple clear guidance - practice - expert feedback) it's time to take your first steps in creating a Verbal Brand that gives you the exact words you need precisely when you need them.<br><br>Click here to take quiz / download book / set up a call&nbsp;</div>
