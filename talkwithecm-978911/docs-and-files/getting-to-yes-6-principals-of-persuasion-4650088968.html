      Getting to YES -&gt; 6 principals of persuasion
      
    </h1>

    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>Science Of Persuasion = SHORT CUTS + ETHICAL MANNER = YES!<br><br>1. Reciprocity. We are obliged to give if we have been given something/RECEIVE. (party, favor/whatever)</div><ul><li>Experiment: Tips - Does the giving of a mint have any influence on the tip you leave?</li><li>1 mint/fortune cookie +3%</li><li>2 mint +14%</li><li>1, pause, then 2nd mint +23%</li><li>Key principle: BE THE FIRST TO GIVE PERSONALIZED &amp; UNEXPECTED</li></ul><div>2. Scarcity. If it's scarce, we want it more. Use this principle by highlighting the Benefits, Unique and what you will LOSE if you don't do/have/consider this thing</div><div><br></div><div>3. Authority. We are more likely to comply with a request if it is coming from a perceived authority/expert. CREDIBLE / KNOWLEDGEABLE / EXPERTS -&gt; Signal to others that you are credible/knowledgable/expert before making request - wearing a uniform, displaying medical certificates / diplomas /etc.&nbsp;<br><br>(Introductions from others WORK - the science says even if the person is connected to you &amp; will benefit, it doesn't change the fact that dropping some juicy info about you really will persuade people to trust you.<br><br>4. Consistency. We want to be consistent with our past commitments, even if the initial commitment is much smaller.<br>Looking for / asking for small commitments before the big ask.&nbsp;<br>Experiment - simple sign in yard support a drive safely campaign<br>group a - very few people were willing....<br>group b -4x as many people 400% INCREASE - why, because 10 days before they had already committed to posting a small post card sized sticker in their window - 400% increase<br><br>Voluntary +active + public commitments = ideally in writing&nbsp;<br><br><br>5. Liking. We like people who are similar, who give us compliments and who co-operate with us.</div><ul><li>similar</li><li>compliments</li><li>cooperate with us on mutual goals</li></ul><div>Ok, so what does this have to do with persuasion, business, getting to yes?? EVERYTHING&nbsp;<br>Experiment:&nbsp;<br>2 groups of MBA students entered into business negotiations</div><ul><li>group a - 'time is money' get down to business 55% were able to reach a negotiated outcome</li><li>group b - before you begin negotiating, exchange some personal info, identify a similarity you share in common, then negotiate - 90% came to agreements typical worth about 20% more to both parties&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><div>6. Consensus. If others (especially similar others) are doing it, then we are more likely to do it ourselves.<br>Hotel towels -&nbsp;<br>eco 35% compliance<br>75% of guests reuse towels - 26% increase<br>75% of people who stay in THIS room reuse their towel - 33% increase<br><br>6 Scientifically validated principles of persuasion that provide for SMALL, PRACTICAL &amp; often COSTLESS changes that can lead to BIG differences in your ability to influence and persuade others in an entirely ethical way.&nbsp;</div>

      <div>6 phrases that instantly persuade people<br><br>(not a substitute for a solid strategy / empathy, but add these phrases into your vocabulary &amp; you'll be amazed)<br><br>1. Have you ever made an exception? Would it be possible to make one exception this time? -- gate keepers, trying to follow the rules, trigger their memory of making an exception<br><br>2. If I were in your position, I'd feel the same exact way...(give details to validate their standpoint), but X,Y,Z.... helps, break down dug in resistance.&nbsp;<br><br>3. Job interview -&nbsp;<br><br>4. Name - this is huge, creates a connection... even with name tags...when people hear their name, they wonder if you know each other &amp; feel instantly connected. Let's take a gatekeeper example...maybe you've already taken the time to interact previously...Host/hostess at a restaurant - How's it going in their tonight Dave? - Uh, good, busy. (do we know each other?), then when you ask for an exception later, you've already established a connection<br><br>5. Yes ladder - telemarketer...<br>is this the right address?<br>Is this the correct number?&nbsp;<br>walk up a YES ladder<br>I like to use an example from my days as a dance teacher...<br>ever heard of swing music / swing dancing?<br>does it seem like something you would like?<br>would you like to try it sometime?<br>3 yeses - great, there is a taster class this Friday at 8...</div>
