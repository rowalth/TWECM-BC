      <div><strong>&nbsp;How to instantly connect with your audience and compel them to take action without sounding like a sleazy used car salesperson <br><br>Biggest secret top sales people use to convince you to buy &amp; it is not manipulation <br><br></strong>Sitting in business school, I'll never forget when my two worlds collided - my love of maths &amp; science and my passion for arts &amp; humanities. <br><br>Business Development 101: What is the most memorable kind of communication? A good old-fashioned story, of course! Throughout history and even today, a good story is the most effective way to connect the mind to the soul. <br><br>The <strong>art</strong> of storytelling is a cherished tradition and an entertaining and effective way to convey information about almost any subject. <br><br>The <strong>science</strong> of storytelling transforms a dry list of facts into something memorable and can even compel others to take action. <br><br>And just like that everything that I had learned up until that point came crashing together in one great epiphany - <strong>The Power of Storytelling.</strong><br><br>Listen in on any classroom and you'll find teachers educating their students with stories. Watch interactions in a major corporations around the world and you'll find high profile CEOs expressing thoughts, opinions, and facts to their employees with stories. Politicians include stories in their speeches to create more emotional connection with their audience. Wherever you go, storytelling is a powerful means of communication. <br><br>Great brands understand that as humans we are hardwired for stories and use storytelling to connect, engage, and move listeners on an emotional level… to tears, to laughter, to anger, to sympathy, to action. <br><br><em>“Storytelling is one of the most powerful ways to breathe life into your brand and is also one of the main components of a solid content marketing approach.” ~ David Campbell, Right Inbox</em><br><br><strong>Why Should We Tell Stories? </strong>Scientific studies have proven again and again that each of us has a desire, even a need, to tell and hear stories. By sharing our stories with others, and indulging in their stories, we learn to understand one another at a much deeper level. By creating a common level of understanding, we come together as a community of individuals – appreciating both the differences and similarities we share. It is possible to convey your thoughts, feelings, and experiences through stories. By doing so, you're verbally expressing the things you value, the customs you take part in, and the wisdom you've acquired in life. Have you ever felt that you didn't have anything interesting to share? Have you ever wished that you could grip audiences with the power of a good story?&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>If so, you'll be happy to know that there are <strong><em>many</em></strong><em> </em>stories within you, just waiting to be told! And by becoming a more effective storyteller, you can overcome feelings of isolation and develop a stronger connections with others. <br><br><em>“Storytelling, when done right, will pull a consumer into the world of a brand to see a different perspective, showing them the bigger picture. The story is an invitation for someone to participate in something bigger than themselves, something they believe in.” Joe Teo, Hey Orca<br></em><br></div><div><strong>4 Elements of Becoming a Great Storyteller&nbsp;</strong></div><div>Even if you've <strong>NEVER</strong> told a story in your life, you <strong><em>can</em></strong><em> </em>become a great storyteller! With a little effort and practice, your storytelling skills will improve and people will be drawn to what you have to say.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Here are 4 key elements for telling great stories:&nbsp;</div><div><strong>1. Ensure that your presence is prominent. </strong>You must have the attention of your audience, whether it's a small group of friends or a large crowd. The goal here is to captivate your audience so they want to hear more. In order to do so, you'll want speak clearly and deliberately with an upright posture and confident demeanor. There's nothing more annoying than only hearing parts of a good story.&nbsp;</div><div><strong>• </strong>Self-confidence plays a large role in making your presence prominent in a room. Take the time to remember WHY you are telling your story, the value you are bringing to others and the reasons why they will thank you after you finish. People do want to hear what you have to say.</div><div><br><strong>2. Connect with and engage your audience. </strong>Connecting with your audience on an emotional level is important. When you're able to authentically connect with others, you'll draw in the interest of the crowd and your story won't fall on deaf ears. This means understanding <em>who </em>they are, <em>what </em>they desire, <em>why </em>they're there, and <em>how </em>to speak to them. Once a deep connection is established, telling a good story gets easier and sometimes I have even found that the audience actually helps GROW the story!</div><div><strong>• </strong>Be mindful to talk and relate to your audience on an equal level. Timid voices and condescending tones can push people away. You shouldn't let your ego take over and talk down to people, nor should you let wavering self-confidence make you timid. We're all human with the desire to be understood and connect, so eliminate any negative perceptions or mental barriers from your mind.&nbsp;</div><div><strong>• </strong>Match how you speak with whom you're speaking to. Your tone, language, and attire should be different when you're talking to a kindergarten group versus a group of women over 30. Try to precisely understand what the audience goes through day-in and day-out and shape your story to match their experiences.&nbsp;</div><div><br><strong>3. Interact with your audience. </strong>Audience involvement is a simple technique to draw people in and help them feel involved in your story. You can ask questions, set up activities, or even welcome others share their experiences. This keeps your audience tuned in because they actually become part of the story.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>• </strong>Humor is another technique that can help you engage and interact with an audience and create more relatability but don't force it. Forcing humor into a story where it doesn't belong is awkward for both the storyteller and the audience.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>4. Offer value. </strong>When listening to your story, your audience wants to gain something, ideally they are looking for edutainment. That is a bit of education in an entertaining way. Most people don't want to simply learn about you; usually they want to learn something of value from your experience that they can apply in their own lives. Structuring your story in a way to present a clear situation or problem that people can relate to and a solution or moral, provides a much deeper meaning and value that the audience can identify with.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>When you gain the full attention of your audience, you have the ability to connect with them on an emotional level and interact with them authentically, that way you can more closely identify with their personal situations and leave them on the edge of their seats waiting to hear more. The truth is that you have value to offer and stories to share - all it takes is a bit of training to master the art and science of storytelling.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div></div>
