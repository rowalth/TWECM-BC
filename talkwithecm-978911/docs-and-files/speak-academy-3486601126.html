<strong>Do You Feel Like You Have So Much To Offer The World But You Can't Seem To Communicate Effectively When You Need To?</strong></li><li>​&nbsp; <strong>Have You Ever Experienced A Situation Where Yo Missed Out On An Opportunity Because You Didn't Know What To Say?</strong></li><li><strong>&nbsp;

Storyteller In No Time Flat</strong></div><div>In fact, what you’ll see is a proven and 100% guaranteed way of taking any message and have it resonate so deeply,&nbsp; that it will make people happily comply.<br><br>And it:</div><ul><li>​<strong>Works if you need to sell products and services.</strong></li><li><strong>​Works if you need to create a powerful marketing message that creates buyers.<br></strong><br></li><li><strong>​Works if you're trying to pitch an idea. &nbsp;<br></strong><br></li><li>​<strong>Works if you’re trying to brand yourself.</strong></li><li>​<strong>Works in corporate America (trying to get a job, promotion or command peers)</strong></li><li><strong>&nbsp;Works in both business and social settings.<br></strong><br></li></ul><div>Best part of all…</div><div><strong>I Guarantee It Will Work The First Time You Try It – Or It’s FREE!</strong></div><div>Here's what this is all about.</div><div><br></div><div>My name is Paul Mascetta.<br><br>I’ve been teaching people influence and persuasion techniques for the past 16 years.<br><br>I’ve helped over 10,000 people master the art of influence.<br><br>I’ve generated millions of dollars for my clients by understanding how to make their customers say “yes”.<br><br>But I didn’t discover this formula during any of those times.<br><br>I discovered it when all of that almost fell to pieces.<br><br>In 2004 a friend of mine started an online business .<br><br>He asked me to write his sales copy because he didn’t have the money to pay a “real copywriter”.<br><br>&nbsp;I was like “WTF is sales copy?”<br><br>He told me that copy is nothing more than salesmanship in print.<br><br>And I was a salesman.<br><br>So all I needed to do was write words that sell his products the same way I sold things to people when I was face to face.<br><br>And so I started writing copy.<br><br>I was doing this while still holding down a full time job.<br><br>He was begging me to quit my job to do it full time but I was scared to take the plunge.<br><br>So I kept writing.<br><br>And in the process he became rich.<br><br>This little sales copy side gig that I had was generating millions of dollars for his business.<br><br>As his business grew my paychecks got bigger.<br><br>Suddenly I was making more money in a few hours from my desk than I was working a full work week at my job so I decided to give this “full time copy” thing a try.<br><br>Quitting my full time job with a family to support was a very risky decision.<br><br>So I decided right then and there to fully commit to mastering the art of copy.<br><br>But more than that I was going to give myself a world class education in persuasion.<br><br>I wasn't gonna just "wing it" using my previous sales experience like I did in the past.<br><br>And so my journey into the world of understanding how human behavior can be influenced began.<br><br>I immersed myself in anything and everything I could get my hands on.<br><br>I read books.<br><br>Probably over 200 of them.<br><br>I attended seminars.<br><br>I read journals and studies on human psychology.<br><br>I studied the great communicators of the world.<br><br>I applied what I learned and my copy got better.<br><br>Word started to spread.<br><br>I started writing copy like a madman.<br><br>I wrote over 100 sales letters in a 2 year period.<br><br>An average of five sales letter per month.<br><br>But I wasn’t only writing sales letters.<br><br>I was writing presentations and video scripts.<br><br>All sorts of stuff.<br><br>I was basically like a movie writer for online entrepreneurs.<br><br>They had something to sell?<br><br>I wrote the script.<br><br>Videos.<br><br>Podcasts.<br><br>Seminars.<br><br>You name it I had to make it sell.<br><br>Everything was going great until one day.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The Phone Call That Almost<br>Destroyed My Business And Reputation</strong></div><div>I had this client whom I can’t name for legal purposes.<br><br>He’s a big self improvement guru.<br><br>Someone whose name you would instantly recognize.<br><br>I got hired to write a sales script for him.<br><br>Took me a week.<br><br>I put together the best possible script that I could.<br><br>An absolute masterpiece if I do say so myself.<br><br>He was gonna use this script in both a video and at a live seminar to sell from the stage.<br><br>I email it to his agent.<br><br>Put my feet up on the desk and congratulate myself on a job well done.<br><br>A week later the agent calls me and tells me there’s a big problem.<br><br>ZERO sales.<br><br>I nearly fell off my chair!<br><br>What?<br><br>How can that be?<br><br>“Your script sucks! That’s how!”<br><br>I’m pretty sure that was his response.<br><br>Now understand something.<br><br>At this point I was a relatively new entrepreneur and this guy was my biggest client.<br><br>And he paid me over $10,000 to write this script.<br><br>And he was pissed.<br><br>He felt like he was ripped off and was threatening to tell everyone in our circle that I'm no longer a capable copywriter.<br><br>I ask him if we can set an appointment so I could watch him record it on video.<br><br>I show to up to the studio.<br><br>The teleprompter is all set.<br><br>The camera starts rolling.<br><br>That’s when I had an epiphany.<br><br>Listen up because this is really important.<br><br>It doesn’t matter how good the script is if you’re a sh*tty actor.<br><br>In other words knowing what to say is one thing.<br><br>Knowing how and when to say it is a whole ‘nother ballgame.<br><br>You need both technique and delivery.<br><br>Here I was handing this guy what I could only describe as “persuasion gold” and he was screwing it all up.<br><br>And doing so in all sorts of ways.<br><br>Tonality was off.<br><br>Body language didn't match his verbal language.<br><br>He couldn’t tell good stories.<br><br>He didn’t understand how to use metaphors.<br><br>When he sold from the stage he couldn’t answer questions or give a good analogy.<br><br>That’s when I realized I gave him the ingredients but not the recipe.<br><br>Two very different things.<br><br>The ingredients are nothing more than components.<br><br>The recipe is where the magic happens.<br><br>I needed to find a way to fill in the gaps.<br><br>I needed to figure out a way to solve the “other piece of the puzzle”.<br><br>The part that separates the person who knows a few persuasion tricks versus the master communicator.<br><br>It’s one thing to fire off a technique here and there and get someone to buy something.<br><br>It’s a completely different thing to transform yourself into someone who can:</div><ul><li>​<strong>Walk Into A Room &amp; Instantly Own It.</strong></li><li>​<strong>Magnetize People Toward You.</strong></li><li>​<strong>Make Anyone Like You In Seconds.</strong></li><li><strong>&nbsp;Reduce Resistance In People &amp; Make Them Receptive To Your Message.<br></strong><br></li><li><strong>&nbsp;Disarm Even The Most Stubborn People And Make Them Agreeable.<br></strong><br></li><li><strong>&nbsp;Be The Trusted Authority That Others Look Up To.<br></strong><br></li><li><strong>​Be Able To Flawlessly Articulate Your Message<br></strong><br></li></ul><div>See the difference?<br><br>The first is a one trick pony.<br><br>The second is a herd stallion.<br><br>(Actually I think the ‘lead mare’ is the correct name but you get the point)<br><br>So right then and there I started creating what I can only describe as..</div><div><strong>A "Paint by Numbers" Blueprint for Persuasive Speaking</strong></div><div>This wasn't a "product" that I created to sell.<br><br>This was a training that I designed for my $10k client.<br><br>And it only had one goal; to transform him from a complete novice to an expert orator.<br><br>Through all my research and testing different techniques I was able to find patterns that all great communicators follow.<br><br>And from that I created a Five Part Method.</div><ul><li><strong>Part One: Trigger Emotion<br></strong><br></li><li><strong>Part Two: Captivate The Mind<br></strong><br></li><li><strong>Part Three: Assess The Landscape<br></strong><br></li><li><strong>​Part Four: Merge With The Audience</strong></li><li><strong>​Part Five: Influence Thoughts &amp; Behavior<br></strong><br></li></ul><div>In the first part of the method we <strong>Trigger Emotion.</strong><br><br>Humans are emotional creatures.<br><br>We'd like to think we're logical but nothing could be further from the truth.<br><br>We make decisions primarily based on emotion and then we use logic to justify the decision.<br><br>Here's an example.<br><br>Let's take the decision to not jump in front of a moving truck.<br><br>Seems pretty logical right?<br><br>But the truth is that seemingly logical decision is backed by the emotion of fear.<br><br>The fear of death is ultimately what's stopping us.</div><div>Proof That Humans Make Decisions<br>&nbsp;Based On Emotion</div><div>Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio studied people who had received brain injuries that had had one specific effect: to damage that part of the brain where emotions are generated. In all other respects they seemed normal - they just lost the ability to feel emotions.<br><br>The interesting thing he found was that their ability to make decisions was seriously impaired. They could logically describe what they should be doing, in practice they found it very difficult to make decisions about where to live, what to eat, etc.<br><br>In particular, many decisions have pros and cons on both sides. Shall I have the fish or the beef? With no rational way to decide, they were unable to make the decision.<br><br>Knowing this, we must first trigger emotions in people in order to persuade them.<br><br>We Trigger Emotion by understanding some basic psychology like...</div><ul><li><strong>The Difference Between The Conscious and Subconscious Mind</strong></li><li><strong>The Triune Brain Model</strong></li><li><strong>The Six Persuasion Power Levers</strong></li></ul><div>Now this isn't to say we don't use our minds either.<br><br>Remember, after emotion comes logic.<br><br>That's why in the second part of the method we <strong>Captivate the Mind.</strong><br><br>We do that through a highly specialized combination of techniques which include:</div><ul><li><strong>NLP Techniques</strong></li><li><strong>Confidence &amp; Charisma Techniques</strong></li><li><strong>Persuasion Techniques</strong></li><li><strong>​Storytelling, Metaphor, and Analogy Techniques</strong></li></ul><div>Once you understand how to Trigger Emotion and Captivate The Mind it's time to <strong>Assess The Landscape.</strong><br><br>Here's the thing.<br><br>While the principles of persuasion are timeless and universal there are variables involved.<br><br>Things like environment, circumstance and situations dictate which techniques will work best.<br><br>For example, you speak differently at a funeral as opposed to a wedding.<br><br>You don't speak to your boss the same way you speak to your best friend.<br><br>Therefore persuading either of them would require a different approach.<br><br>That's why you would tailor you presentation based on environment like:</div><ul><li><strong>Public Speaking</strong></li><li><strong>Sales Environments</strong></li><li><strong>Negotiations</strong></li><li><strong>Video Presentations</strong></li></ul><div>That's how you morph a persuasive message into whatever you want.<br><br>Then comes what is perhaps the most important part of the method...<br><br><strong>Merging With The Audience</strong><br><br>Regardless of how emotionally appealing or logically sounding you may be if your audience feels disconnected then it's all a waste of time.<br><br>You need to be able to read, understand and connect with your audience.<br><br>You do this by:</div><ul><li><strong>Engaging And Priming Their Mindset</strong></li><li><strong>Using The VAK Model To Connect With Anyone</strong></li><li><strong>Picking Up On Signals Like The Cohesion of Movement &amp; Sound</strong></li></ul><div>Once that's done we move onto the 5th and final part of the method which is <strong>Influencing Thoughts &amp; Behavior.</strong><br><br>You do this by:</div><ul><li><strong>Educating People by Proving New, Valuable Knowledge In A Novel Form</strong></li><li><strong>Simplifying Complex Topics So That They Can Easily Understand Them</strong></li><li><strong>Motivating Them To Take The Actions They Need To Succeed</strong></li><li><strong>​Launching A Movement That Supports And Follows You</strong></li></ul><div>Now as I said that this wasn't a "product" that I created to sell.<br><br>This was a training that I designed for my $10k client.<br><br>That training turned out to be worth tens of thousands of dollars for him.<br><br>And many more clients after him.<br><br>Since creating it I've only offered it to my private clients.<br><br>Only until very recently did I decide to create a full course from it.<br><br>I call it Persuasive Speakology because it's not your "run of the mill" persuasion formula.<br><br>Don't get me wrong. It's loaded with some powerful persuasion techniques.<br><br>But those are just words.<br><br>This is like learning a whole new language.<br><br>Imagine trying to persuade someone in a foreign city where you don't know the language.<br><br>Guess what?<br><br>When most people try to speak persuasively that's exactly what they do.<br><br>They speak a foreign language that doesn't resonate with their audience.<br><br>They either use the wrong words or they use the right words at the wrong time.<br><br>That changes today because today you learn the Language of Persuasion.<br><br>Introducing...</div><div><strong>PERSUASIVE SPEAKOLOGY</strong></div><div><strong><em>(Includes 1 Digital PDF, 20 Video Modules &amp; 20 Audio Modules)</em></strong></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://go.influenceacademy.net/hosted/images/f9/c55c2cda1544c1b4ff1358e13d73d1/ts.png" width="1181" height="722"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

I am a repeat customer of yours. Your materials have pushed me to new levels of interpersonal awareness and communication effectiveness. I thought I was a master at communication-and I was-but you have turbocharged my skills, my effectiveness, and my knowledge base in a way that I would not have believed possible. I have studied this subject at length -and your breadth of knowledge, combined with a presentation style that I find warm, engaging and interesting -is absolutely the best stuff anywhere. Your practical, detailed descriptions and your way of summing up things to do/not do, and things to watch for in other people are so valuable. This component of your materials is absolutely unique to you.I look forward to all that you will create in the future.</div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://go.influenceacademy.net/hosted/images/72/50eb00c69211e796edab2ccabf2942/Screen-Shot-2017-11-10-at-10.42.49-PM.png" width="165" height="250"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">
