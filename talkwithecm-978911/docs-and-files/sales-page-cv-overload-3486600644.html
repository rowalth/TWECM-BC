      <div>Why even the best candidates don't get an interview<br><br>I recently heard a story about a woman, let's call her Sue, who went to a job fair at her university. Walking around with another student, they visited booths, picked up brochures from different companies &amp; gathered information about career opportunities. They both had similar interests and skills. At one booth, her friend asked a few questions, shared her CV &amp; left with the business card of the contact person at the company. Sue was flabbergasted, how did that happen? "She got the contact &amp; I have nothing!"<br><br>Has this ever happened to you? Two people with similar skills and experience, but one gets the job and the other one leaves empty handed. In the story above, it is all about networking - reaching out and making a connection with another person.<br><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 228, 247);">I know you're thinking, "But wait a minute, Elizabeth, she didn't get the job, she just got a contact. Sue can still send her CV - it's the same."<br></span><br></div><div><del>Is it? Is tossing your CV into a pile the same as having a direct contact waiting for your CV? Not really.<br></del><strong><br>The reality of CV overload:</strong><br>With so many job seekers flooding the market with CVs, employers receive an average of 250 applications per job posting. 250! <br><br>The hard truth is that most CVs are cut by computer filters before a human eye even sees it. Despite the painstaking hours you put into making your CV perfect, it is only one small piece of what employers want to know - <strong>who are you and how can you bring value to our team?</strong><br><br>That's the key question - isn't it? Not just for hiring managers or getting a job, but also for making a sales pitch, reaching new clients, opening new markets, negotiating mergers, making friends in a new city - who are you and what value are you bringing into the equation?<br><br><br>So, what are your options?</div><ul><li>You can keep playing the numbers game - it will work eventually.</li><li>You could work with a recruiter or headhunter to make connections for you - but then you'll have to evaluate the cost considering the limited access to diverse companies and competition with other top candidates</li><li>You can start reading books and blogs about how to connect and stand out from others.</li><li>You can sign up for my course and get game changing results within 30 days – guaranteed!</li></ul>
