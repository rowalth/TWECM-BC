    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>Hello Marijo,&nbsp;</div><div>Oh yes, I totally get that &amp; thanks for letting me know. Actually, I’m really glad to hear that you have projects to take you through the end of the year to 2021. I’ve noticed most businesses &amp; people that I’ve talked to have NOT been able to manage things so well this year. That puts you a step ahead of the game - nice!</div><div><br><br></div><div>At the same time, we all know what tends to happen when we put things off for later…later turns into never. I’m not judging you, that is just how life is with everything screaming and demanding our attention. But how will it feel a year from now, 2 years from now, when faced with the same situation, all that will be left are those annoying 'I should have’s &amp; 'If only’s…frustrating, right?&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>In my life I’ve learned, sometimes the hard way, that the only chance we have to make a decision is right now. Really, because we can’t change the past and the future is unknown. For many of us this year will be a defining moment and the choices we make right now will have an impact for years to come.&nbsp; And I am not the kind of person to leave you stranded with a bunch of ‘if only’s piling up around you. So, as I see it you have basically 3 choices right now:<br><br><br>1. Don’t do anything. Keep doing what you have been doing and just wonder how things could have been different.<br>2. Figure it out on your own. Start doing research &amp; putting in the work to figure out the art &amp; science of story architecture. Dip into psychology to discover what draws people in and what really hooks their attention. Read the studies and learn the statistics of what works and what doesn’t until you find a system that works for you.<br>3. Let me do the work for you. Sign up for a mini-session with me, where we focus exclusively on the video you sent me - your story - and nothing else. I’ll give you the exact framework that Hollywood uses to transform stories from a list of facts to completely irresistible. A story session will not be a major time investment for you and, after looking at your video &amp; the work that you’re already put in I can guarantee remarkable results.&nbsp;<br><br><br>You decide.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br></div><blockquote>On 27.10.2020, at 11:46, Marijo EF &lt;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="autolinked" data-behavior="truncate" href="mailto:marijo@eleazarfilm.com">marijo@eleazarfilm.com</a>&gt; wrote:</blockquote><div><br></div><blockquote>Hello, Elizabeth! Thank you very much for your emails. I’m very impressed with how you are establishing this connection with us! I really appreciate your level of service.=)&nbsp;<br>We have just finished our monthly meeting now and finalised the schedules until end of the year. I would have to hold this coaching for now because we are putting all energy to do the productions ahead of us.<br>I will try to get back to this again as soon as I have the white space and I can fully commit.<br>Thank you!<br>Marijo<br><br><blockquote>On 27.10.2020, at 10:21, Elizabeth talkwithecm &lt;<a href="mailto:contact@talkwithecm.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">contact@talkwithecm.com</a>&gt; wrote:</blockquote><br><blockquote>Hi Marijo,&nbsp;<br><br>Floating this email back to the top of your inbox. I’d like to follow up on our conversation from last week.&nbsp;<br>AND…just in case this wasn’t clear before, I am offering you a free - zero obligations - consultation call. This is not just another ‘consultation' disguised as a sales call. This is an opportunity for us to talk 1:1 &amp; see if and how I can help you.&nbsp;<br><br>If this sounds interesting to you, simply hit reply and let me know.&nbsp;<br><br>All the best,&nbsp;<br>Elizabeth<br><br>PS - As always, if you have any questions, or if anything is unclear, please let me know!&nbsp;<br><br><br><blockquote>On 22.10.2020, at 21:23, Elizabeth from talkwithecm &lt;<a href="mailto:contact@talkwithecm.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">contact@talkwithecm.com</a>&gt; wrote:</blockquote><br><blockquote>Hi Marijo,<br><br><br>After watching your videos (the two you sent as well as the ones on your website) &amp; learning a bit more about your story, I am impressed. You &amp; your partner are living your dream - how exciting!<br><br><br>From what I have gathered, it seems that your primary focus until now has been delivering top quality products from behind the camera. I guess it feels strange to suddenly turn things around and be <em>in front </em>of the camera! The spotlight is on YOU for a change and now you need to present yourself as a top level professional…while still being personable, friendly &amp; trustworthy enough for people to open up and share their most treasured moments with you. <br><br><br>This is a big deal. I know what it is to connect with people on a personal level via film, even when you can’t see them in the moment. I am talking about giving viewers the feeling that you are looking though the lens &amp; actually connecting with and listening to their heart / mind / soul, like a real friend. <br><br><br>Now I could tell you about my experiences working with film in the USA &amp; Taiwan, or about how my clients have been able to use what I’ve taught them to get Fulbright scholarships, big promotions at work and even land their dream jobI But rather than talk about all of that, I want to talk about what I can offer you. <br><br><br>Most of us already know what we are about, where our value is, and I will show you how put that into the right words with the right tone &amp; create instant connections with your viewers - every single time. I will help you find your voice by finding your words to establish you &amp; your business, because you ARE your best product.<br><br><br><br>But most importantly, I want you to feel confident about us working together - therefore I suggest that we set up a consultation call. This will be a free consultation call, so you can get to know me a bit more and we can talk about your exact needs and expectations. <br><br><br><br>‌<br>Please select the time that works best for you.<br><strong>Event: </strong>FREE consultation call<br><strong>Timezone: </strong>Central European Time <a href="https://calendly.com/talkwithecm/free-consultation?timezone_picker=1&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Change</a>SAT |&nbsp; | TUE |&nbsp; | WED | Oct 24 |&nbsp; | Oct 27 |&nbsp; | Oct 28 | <br><a href="https://calendly.com/talkwithecm/free-consultation/20201024T1100Z?source=email&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1:00pm</a> |&nbsp; | <a href="https://calendly.com/talkwithecm/free-consultation/20201027T0815Z?source=email&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">9:15am</a> |&nbsp; | <a href="https://calendly.com/talkwithecm/free-consultation/20201028T1930Z?source=email&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8:30pm</a> | <br><a href="https://calendly.com/talkwithecm/free-consultation/20201024T1120Z?source=email&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1:20pm</a> |&nbsp; | <a href="https://calendly.com/talkwithecm/free-consultation/20201027T0835Z?source=email&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">9:35am</a> |&nbsp; | <a href="https://calendly.com/talkwithecm/free-consultation/20201028T1950Z?source=email&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8:50pm</a> | <br><a href="https://calendly.com/talkwithecm/free-consultation/20201024T1140Z?source=email&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1:40pm</a> |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; | <a href="https://calendly.com/talkwithecm/free-consultation/20201028T2010Z?source=email&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">9:10pm</a> | <br>Need another time? <a href="https://calendly.com/talkwithecm/free-consultation?source=email&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">See full list of times</a><br>Powered by <a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Calendly</a><br>‌<br><br>Looking forward to hearing from you soon,&nbsp;<br>Elizabeth</blockquote><br></blockquote><br></blockquote><div></div>
