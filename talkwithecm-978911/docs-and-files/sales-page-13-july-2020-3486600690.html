What a wild ride this has been. 2020 has so far been like a giant bag full of unexpected surprises, like a never-ending worst - birthday - ever.<br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 228, 247);"><br>well, let me tell you about my 2020 story - Or as I like to call it corona crazy!</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 228, 247);">Like many people, Covid-19 changed my professional life. Heck, It changed my whole life.</span><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 228, 247);"> </strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 228, 247);">It even changed the way I talk to people. Listen, I was used to going out, meeting people face to face, hosting meetings, networking events, huge gatherings, you know what I mean. The main focus of everything I did up until that point was all about face to face contact and conversations that matter. And guess how successful I felt, when ALL of that was canceled??&nbsp;<br><br>It was awful!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 228, 247);">Suddenly, all of my off-line skills - everything my professional career was based on - were stuck - at home, I felt everything I had worked so hard to build up, was slipping away, like sand running through my fingers, and I had no idea how to save it, how to transfer my offline skills ONLINE.</span></div><div><br></div><div>The old way of doing things - networking, building up relationships face to face, in person sales, interviews, everything - had to change. At the start, I felt like flushing all of my old approaches down the toilet - with most of the world stuck at home.&nbsp; <br><br><del>I totally did not see any of this coming, and yet, here we are. Each of us kind of getting used to this crazy, and doing our best to make it as 'normal' as we can.<br></del><br></div><div><del>And now I am wondering about what else is lurking around the corner... What can we expect? What should we plan for? What else does 2020 have in store just waiting to unfold and flip everything upside down again??</del></div><div><del><br>And no one is immune. We are all touched in one way or anther:<br>Relationships, health, security, finances - ALL OF IT.<br><br>People are behaving differently, online and face to face. People are spending more time connecting online now than ever before. Online meetings have become such a normal part of everyday life that Zoom is now a verb! <br><br>Business is changing. Hiring processes and onboarding are going digital. Even buying and selling is changing. The way people shop, compare products and finally decide to buy is taking on a whole set of expectations that wasn't there 8 months ago.<br><br>Most people are struggling. Trying to keep up. Striving to keep clients on board and making attempts to up their social media presence to attract new clients.&nbsp; </del><br><br><br><br>I know I'm not alone. A lot of people and businesses are desperately trying to get online - maybe you are too. Looking for quick answers to shift their offline activities online without investing time they don't have to learn everything from scratch and without coming across as salesy or like a complete scam. <br><br>I get it. I struggled hard a few years ago, when I first started down the path to shift my offline business online.&nbsp; <del>- and create my dream of a location independent life! I had the dream in mind - palm beaches and online meetings - but the reality looks&nbsp; </del>Just a few years ago, I had no idea how to behave online. I wrote articles that 2 people read, me and my partner. I made posts that people just scrolled on by. I created webpages that no one responded to. I fumbled awkwardly with my words trying to grab attention and convince people to buy. I thought that was the goal, right? <br><br>Buy now! right?<br><br>I listened to 'experts' advice, and decided to spread my net wider. When LinkedIn was hot, I made an account that 3 people looked at. Blab, Twitter, Instagram, Twitch, Snapchat...I tried all kinds of different hacks and gimmicks, but nothing gave me the real connections that I wanted. <br><br>Once I even I bought prizes thinking that a giveaway would be a fun way to explode my contact list, and it was, until it didn't work - AT ALL. I got two email addresses - TWO. I felt totally stupid awarding 1st &amp; 2nd prize with confetti. Third prize was never claimed. It was so frustrating. I knew something was missing, but I couldn't figure out what it was.<br><br>I could see others succeeding. I saw other businesses making big money with cheap looking websites and products that didn't offer half the value of what I was giving away for free. What secret sauce were they using? What did they know that I didn't?<br><br>I tried using social media and it totally baffled me. Who's out there? Who's watching and judging me based on a 15 second video? Honestly, I didn't even feel confident putting a photo of my face online. So, I spent hours finding the best looking stock photos and tried to make everything look like it came out of a professional production studio. But, no one was impressed. <br><br>A few times I came very close to giving up - because the idea of me having a thriving online business seemed as realistic as a cat opening a scuba school. <br><a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTYDtFaYQdmT37gCsZqQDcsU_qUmacxj1tkhmjArVzTOF7aexKf&amp;usqp=CAU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTYDtFaYQdmT37gCsZqQDcsU_qUmacxj1tkhmjArVzTOF7aexKf&amp;usqp=CAU</a><br><br>Would <em>you</em> pay this cat to teach you to dive?<br><br><strong>The good news</strong> is that I <strong>didn't </strong>give up. <del>I kept trying, tweaking things here and there, believing in the idea of my business and the value that I can deliver.<br></del><br>After studying, testing, and improving for years, I identified a few simple beliefs holding me back… and some key insights that completely changed how I approach people and start conversations online, people I already knew and people I just met - I’ll tell you about those a little bit further down this page.<br><br></div><div>The point is, I slowly and painfully crawled out of it — and at this point I'm even expanding my online business - yes, even during the pandemic! Offers, email addresses, clients, income? yes - all of it!<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>The bad news</strong> is that there is no funnel, no strategy, no sales video, no ad campaign, no hack or gimmik - nothing is going to replace the key deciding factor in every decision - the human element - conversations and personal relationships. Whether it is reading a personal story, getting a referral from a friend, public reviews, testimonials or even talking to a sales rep, most people won't even <strong>think </strong>about getting out their wallet without some form of personal contact. <br><br>Think about that - personal connections and meaningful contact points are a vital part of doing business online, and the current pandemic has amplified that even more! <br><br>People feel stuck, frustrated and are sick of feeling overlooked. People crave connection now more than ever before. <br><br><strong>So, if you are looking to stand out from the crowd, create trust and let people see your true value - it is time to take a serious look at how you are building relationships online. <br><br>Relationships are the single greatest competitive advantage that you can get. <br><br></strong>The real key to success that most people don't talk about is relationships and your ability to connect with people and build relationships is the single greatest competitive advantage that you can get. The good news is that the ability to form stronger relationships can be taught.</div><div><br></div><div>You know, it doesn’t matter what area of life you want to succeed in, either...</div><div><br></div><div>Professionally? It will come from your relationships...</div><div>Personally? Romantically? It will come from your relationships...</div><div><br></div><div>So, what is the QUICKEST and MOST EFFECTIVE path to building relationships?</div><div><br></div><div>It’s NOT LinkedIn...</div><div>It’s NOT Social Media...</div><div><br></div><div>It is...</div><div><strong>talking directly to people and </strong><span style="background-color: rgb(242, 237, 255);">infusing your messaging with passion - intimacy - commitment - the three key pieces you need for any meaningful relationship.</span></div><div>And no matter how advanced a new social media platform or a innovative sales funnel may be, the need for human connection and conversations are not going away ever.</div><div><br></div><div>Can you afford to continue making meaningless posts and pitches that do nothing to engage your audience or advance your career?</div><div><br><br><br>Your Brand <br><br>So, what is your <strong>core message</strong>? This is your foundation and will determine what your path to success will look like. Is it going to be a long track up to the peak of a mountain, an uphill battle in the snow, sleet and rain? Or will it be more like a walk down to the beach, listening to your favorite tunes along the way?<br><br>Sometimes it really is as simple as that. Are people responding to your message with likes, comments, shares, screaming "YES - I need this!" and throwing their wallets at you? Or are you staring at an empty bank account and wondering why people just aren't responding? <br><br>If you are offering something people don't need....it's hard! You'll spend way to much time trying to convince people, begging people to just try your product. No one wants to do that. <br><br>But if you are offering value and can help them solve a problem, get rid of a pain, eliminate a frustration once and for all - your path to success will look more like this: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">beach</a><br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><del><br>With so many job seekers flooding the market with CVs, employers receive an average of 250 applications per job posting. 250!<br></del><br></div><div><del>The hard truth is that most CVs are cut by computer filters before a human eye even sees it.
