      <div>The Quest<br><br>I was a pretty happy-go-lucky smiley kid...and I always knew in my heart that I was destined for great things! But what I didn't know then was HOW CHALLENGING life can be and how many challenges I'd have to overcome in the process.<br><br>Thanks to my mother's unwavering belief &amp; support though out the years, even as a small child I felt that everything was within my reach if I was willing to put in the work.&nbsp;<br><br>Receive a mission<br>(internal or external)<br>I was the first in my family to get a college eduction. I loved learning and did really well in school. In fact one of my favorite games as a child was playing school - I just couldn't get enough!&nbsp;<br><br>Accept mission as<br>your purpose&nbsp;<br>As I was preparing myself for college, I felt lost - overwhelmed by the process of finding a school, applying, getting in, etc. I tried to find mentors, but really felt lost in the jungle.&nbsp;<br><br>Set off,<br>overcome obstacles<br>During my last year of high school, I arranged to visit a school that I was interested in going to - a perspective students weekend. I planned to go with two of my friends...but we never got there. We never arrived. On our drive across the mountains of Pennsylvania our car was hit by a coal truck - a tri-axle coal truck - and the impact of the crash sent me into a 3 day coma.&nbsp;<br><br>My bright future dimmed. With a severe brain injury it was unclear if I would ever wake up - walk - talk or even be myself again. During the time of my recovery the was an outpouring of support from my community.&nbsp;<br><br>People we knew closely offered practical support for my family - people we didn't know so well, offered care and well wishes, even people I had never met before were touched and wanted to reach out in any way they could to help.&nbsp;<br><br>As a 17 year old - I had an overwhelming feeling awe - how my life - just me being alive impacts and touches so many. Most of us don't get to see that in clear and tanglible ways that I was able to see it - the cards, the calls, the physical outreach - but even if you can't see it - it is true. Each of us touch and have the ability to impact the lives of so many around us.<br><br>When I left the rehab center and returned home, I spoke out in churches and schools that had been touched by my story.&nbsp;<br><br>Gather others to help<br>you on your mission<br>With this newly gained knowledge, I felt I had an even bigger reason do something with this precious life I was given...I was ready, I was willing...but WHAT?? What was I meant to do?&nbsp;<br><br>I decided that it was time to find out - I went to Asia to 'find myself' Now mind you, this was back in the 90's when it was not so common for white women, especially single white women to go backpacking around in Asia - so I set up a plan<br><br>Test of strength<br>and comittment<br><br><br>Achieve<br>your mission!<br><br>Quest<br><br>Yours is a story of purpose. You have always known you were here to make<br>an impact, maybe it took you a while to realise but your deeper calling, but now it is what drives you.<br><br>Your message, YOUR STORY is what others need to hear. Lift your voice and share with the exact people who need what you have to offer.&nbsp;<br><br>As a mission driven brand your audience are motivated by your passion and<br><br>inspired to join</div>
