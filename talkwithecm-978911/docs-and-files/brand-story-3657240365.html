      <div>I applied for a job, but got a business instead!<br><br>It was another job interview. I felt a rush going in, not because I was nervous, but because I knew exactly what to say and do to get a job offer. Even though I never met the interviewer before, I was on familiar territory. After countless interviews, job applications and networking events, I felt prepared, alert &amp; ready.<br><br>It was like a game...after a quick assessment, I knew exactly what to say and do to pique their interest and get the job. But then, when I did get the offer...well, the rush went away. It was weird, like I was more excited about pursuing the job than actually getting it. I had had this feeling before, but I always brushed it aside. This time I couldn't just brush it aside...believe me, I tried. This time was different.&nbsp;<br><br>There was something bigger, nagging at me &amp; telling me that this job was not the right path for me.&nbsp;<br><br>Cracking the code<br><br>About a week later, a university student called me up, invited me out for coffee, asking for advice. It was amazing meeting with her, I could see so much of myself sparkling in her eyes - Big dreams, hopes and even a few fears. She was hungry to crack the code - to find the right words, the right connections, the right system to find her yes!&nbsp;<br><br>In her case, she was highly qualified, skilled &amp; talented ...but never paid. She had heaps of volunteer experience, student projects and more. But no employer wanted to be the first to hire her 'with no experience,' and yet she had SO MUCH experience! I gave her some tips about how to present herself /her experience with a few key mindset shifts and told her to keep in touch. I didn't actually expect to hear from her again, but a few weeks later, she called and told me that after three years of trying and failing she now had three exciting job offers to choose from!<br><br>This was a HUGE wake up call for me - if the system I developed for me, worked for her, could it work for others too?&nbsp; I had to find out.&nbsp;<br><br>I tested the waters, put out some information &amp; people loved it! The results were coming in and what excited me the most about this was the excitement and joy people shared with me. Telling me about the dramatic changes they were making in their own lives.&nbsp;<br><br>So, I knew that I was onto something...but I wasn't sure what. When I tried to expand my reach and connect with people who didn't already know me things got confusing - like mega confusing:<br>"Oh - so you help people get jobs, like HR specialist!"&nbsp;<br>...well, not exactly...<br>"Do you write cover letters &amp; do CV reviews?"<br>...not usually...<br>"Are you a headhunter? Host a job portal?"<br>...no...<br>"So, uuummm...what exactly do you offer?"<br>Confidence!&nbsp;<br><br>"Oh, like a coach?"<br>Maybe..? I wasn't sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Branding - from the ground up<br><br>I tried taking my idea to different language institutes and job training platforms, but nothing really panned out. Either they didn't understand my concept, or they weren't flexible enough to incorporate my ideas into their existing programs. So, I went back to the drawing board - to create an irresistible offer, something that they just couldn't refuse!&nbsp;<br><br>In the process of shaping my offer, I took a break and shifted my focus. I had the opportunity to dive headfirst into one of my greatest passions - Swing and blues Dancing! I used my teaching and community development skills to help build up a large scene in Vienna, Austria. Starting from small house parties in my living room to hosting the largest weekly swing dance in Austria and earning the honor of being elected as the Vice President and later on the board of our local organization - ighop, I gained first hand experience and deep insights from some great mentors about what it takes to establish and create loyal following around a brand.&nbsp;<br><br>Systems that work<br><br>I love working one on one with people, especially beginners, giving them the confidence to jump out on the dance floor and have a great time. Using my experience teaching refugees basic English skills - from ABC &amp; 123 - I knew exactly how to break large topics into bite sized pieces for early and continued success. Fun-sized pieces!&nbsp;<br><br>In the local dance scene, I positioned myself as the beginners pal - yup a niche within a niche - and created a system to get more people out on the dance floor from day one. I shared this system with others and it really worked! As a team, we successfully welcomed more adults faster than ever on the dance floor - even those who claimed to have two left feet!&nbsp;<br><br>I know how to make the IMPOSSIBLE - POSSIBLE!&nbsp;<br><br>Swinging back to business<br><br>Life is often a game of balance. Many times I feel like an alchemist - mixing and testing different combinations to find just the right mix. After 4 years of building up the dance community here in Vienna, I felt it was time to swing back to my business roots, but this time on my own terms.<br><br><br>AFTER - talking about the FEELING</div><ul><li>I didn't just want a fluke, or a lucky streak, I wanted a system, a framework, something that I knew I could stand on every single time....plus time, experimenting, learning, perfecting</li><li>today people are begging me to share my secrets.&nbsp;</li></ul><div></div>
