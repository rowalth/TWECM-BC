      <div>Hi there!&nbsp;<br>Elizabeth here.&nbsp;<br>Thanks for the opportunity to meet together at the PWN Webinar on June 28th.<br>We really covered a lot of information and some deep topics in a short amount of time = Bravo!&nbsp;<br><br>I loved hearing your feedback and takeaways:</div><ul><li>New options for moving forward</li><li>Mindset Detox</li><li>You are always one decision away from a totally different life</li></ul><div>....and yet, I feel like we are just starting a much bigger conversation - one that I would like to continue.</div><div><br>Today, I would like to share some of the biggest misconceptions of going LIVE that I have seen and experienced myself. These are negative made-up stories we tell ourselves that are usually not true.&nbsp;</div><div><br>These aren’t tiny things that don’t matter in the grand scheme of things... I’m talking about thoughts or even full scripts that we might easily brush aside or even ignore in the moment, but actually have the power to hold us back and prevent us from finally living the life we want.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Interested to hear about them? Read on!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>SCRIPT #1 - Meh, that's not for me.</strong></div><div><br>I hear this all the time! A HUGE misconception that people have, especially professionals, is thinking that creating live videos is just for young people, super savvy Gen Z, and Millennials.&nbsp; Let me tell you that using a personal touch to connect with people online is NOT just for Instagram stars, tech geeks and TikTok heroes. It is a powerful tool that can be used by anyone - in fact, it becomes even more powerful when seen in a place you don't expect. Let me give you an example - imagine how you would feel opening a message from your boss / supervisor or the head of a company that you're interested in and suddenly you see a personalised video! <br>"Hi there. Just wanted to let you know that I'm thinking of you. I know that things have been a bit stressful this past week. So, I want to reach out to you live with this video. <br>Looking forward to connecting with you next week."<br><br>BOOM! Big deal - right? And you can make this kind of an impact too!<strong><br></strong><br></div><div><strong><br>SCRIPT #2 - Sure, sounds great, but I can't now. <br></strong><br>This is another big one, right? How many times have we said that in the past? SO MANY! Yet, time keeps on going and opportunities for change just pass on by.&nbsp; The funny thing is that as humans we consistently OVERestimate what we can accomplish in a day and UNDERestimate what we can actually accomplish in a year.&nbsp;<br><br>Want an example? Think about new year's resolutions - exercise more, get healthy, spend more time with my kids...totally underestimated what is possible with an entire YEAR! If we were to actually sit down and calculate 365 days or 52 weeks...that opens up a lot more possibilities.&nbsp;</div><ul><li>run 365 miles / try 52 new recipes</li><li>create 365 social media posts / 52 live videos</li></ul><div>See how this works?<br><br>And, I always like to turn this around and ask myself:<br>A year from now, what will you wish you had started today?<br><br>BOOM! Big deal - right?</div><div><strong><br>SCRIPT #3 - That sounds fine, but no one is going digital in my industry<br></strong><br></div><div>Right. It is not easy to be first. I get that. Let me tell you about one of my clients. She loves to travel and was teaching English to support her passion. Following the standard school calendar, she scheduled her travels during the summer and holiday breaks.&nbsp;<br><br>After working together, she was able to shift most of her work online which opened so many more possibilities to create her dream life:</div><ul><li>year round travel - online classroom</li><li>more free time - automation</li><li>keep the personal touch that her students love - personalised mini videos</li><li>reach more clients - expanded digital reach</li></ul><div>Sounds like a dream, doesn't it?&nbsp;<br>The best part is that she didn't have to change her field or gain more skills. She just needed a clear system to match what she was already doing offline.&nbsp;</div><div><br><strong>SCRIPT #4 - Some people are just better at doing live videos than others, besides my presentation skills are fine. <br><br></strong>That's probably true.<strong> </strong>Of course each person is born with different traits and natural talents, but most skills - including communication and presentation skills - CAN be&nbsp;learned. <br><br>The real key to success that most people don't talk about is relationships. Your ability to connect with people is the single greatest competitive advantage that you can get, and this is even more true now in the time of physical distancing. The good news is that the ability to connect and form stronger relationships can be learned.</div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>What about you?<br></strong>Which of these misconceptions do you have? Or do you have more than one?<br><br>Use this link and let me know - <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="autolinked" data-behavior="truncate" href="https://goto.talkwithecm.com/connect">https://goto.talkwithecm.com/connect</a>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>One more thing, I have had all of these misconceptions at some point myself, so I definitely will NOT judge you. Let me know!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>All the best,&nbsp;<br>Elizabeth</div>
