      <div><em>For everyone struggling with Day 3 Homework I want to emphasize what Bushra said in today's lesson. I think we often miss this when we're caught up in the specifics of 'what' we're selling.<br><br>At the end of the day we're selling an experience and feeling far more than we are the specifics of the product itself.<br><br></em><em style="background-color: rgb(255, 228, 247);">Low self worth and lack of confidence? You're selling the courage to make changes that mean they don't have to live the rest of their lives feeling small, insignificant and missing out. They stand taller, speak more clearly, set better boundaries, are willing to walk away from toxic situations because they KNOW they deserve better. Because of this, they slide into the driver's seat of their own lives and take control, instead of helplessly cowering in the passenger seat while their life veers off into a tree. </em><em><br><br>Anxious families dealing with homeschooling stress? You're bringing joy, harmony and laughter into their homes again, breaking that tension and actually creating good memories during a time that is so hard to enjoy. You're introducing more intimacy, more bonding time, more hugs and 'thank yous', more honesty and openness even when it's hard to be vulnerable. You're letting families find real connection together so that they never look back regretting, feeling they could have done more to be happier.<br><br>Health and weightloss? You're reuniting people with their bodies again after feeling so out of control, so ugly, so unlovable. They get to move and dance and play again. They stop deliberately ignoring the mirror every morning in an attempt to NOT have a bad day from seeing what they look like and hating it. They get to love every inch of their flesh because of what you offer them.<br><br>Business and Finances? You're helping people </em><em style="background-color: rgb(255, 228, 247);">be their own bosses so they never have to feel their creativity caged again. Getting more clients so that they never have to chase someone down or lower their integrity by begging people to buy. You offer them the experience of NEVER anxiously checking their bank account to make sure they have enough to eat next month.</em><em><br><br>We think we're selling products with all the bells and whistles but we're really selling experiences that change lives. The more we spell it out and speak to the heart of what people want so badly to be different in their lives, the more we use language that communicates how deeply real and human our desires are, the more sales we'll make.<br></em></div>
