</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>You don’t have to look like a model or have the verbal skills of a senator to be a fascinating person.</div><div><br>Everyone you know is fascinating, if only you knew them well enough to see it.</div><blockquote>With limited time, you have to do a little more than just be yourself to be the most fascinating person in the room.</blockquote><div><br>You’ll need to stretch yourself a little bit.</div><div><br></div><h1>Use These Tips And You Can Be The Most Fascinating Person At Your Next Social Gathering</h1><h1>1. Look your best.</h1><div><br>Dress average, and people will assume that you’re average. We notice those who dress sharply. A perfect haircut catches our eye.&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Shine your shoes.&nbsp;</li><li>Be bold in your clothing choices.&nbsp;</li><li>Have a unique style.</li></ul><div>Even years after the fact, one woman told me that she still remembers the cool socks I was wearing when we first met.<br><br></div><h1>2. Focus on others.</h1><div><br>If you want people to think you’re fascinating, make them believe that you think they’re fascinating. People remember how you make them feel, and if you can make someone think that <em>they’re</em> the most interesting person in the room, you won’t be forgotten soon.<br><br><br></div><h1>3. Lead an interesting life.</h1><div><br>If your life is interesting, and you’re willing to share it, you’ll be seen as interesting too. Travel, have unique experiences, and pursue interesting hobbies. Most people simply drag themselves to work, watch TV &amp; go shopping. By investing your time to develop other interests and hobbies, you'll not only be more fascinating to others, but you’ll also enjoy your life a lot more too.<br><br><br></div><h1>4. Talk about things you’re passionate about.</h1><div><br>When you talk about things that interest you, you have an enthusiasm that’s attractive to people. It draws people in, without them even realizing what is happening. What's your passion? Talk about it with others. Share your enthusiasm with everyone and notice how well people respond to you.<br><br></div><h1>5. Be conﬁdent.</h1><div><br>Whether it is fair or not, nervous people aren’t assumed to be interesting. We’re naturally drawn to conﬁdent, charismatic people. Remember, you don’t have to actually be conﬁdent, just pay attention and be mindful of nervous body language.&nbsp;<br><br></div><h1>6. Collect topics.</h1><div><br>Pay attention to conversations that are happening around you. What are people talking about? What makes people laugh? Take notes and keep this in mind when speaking. If you are regularly in a group of people who likes talking about the news, or sports, take the time to inform yourself about these topics before you meet. The more you know, the more opportunities you have to be an interesting person. We like intelligent people that can tell us things we don’t already know. Make a habit of reading and learning something new each day.<br><br></div><h1>7. Maintain some mystery.</h1><div><br>It’s easier to be interesting if you don’t reveal every detail about your life all at once. Even the people you see daily at work should wonder a little bit about who you are inside and why you do the things you do. Keep an air of mystery around your personal life.<br><br>Don't let this go to far, to the point of annoying people and eventually pushing them away.&nbsp;<br><br></div><h1>8. Be unpredictable.</h1><div><br>We’re fascinated by people we can’t predict 100%. Be the person that comes into work and announces that you’re going to Nepal on vacation, or that you went out to that fancy new Italian place last night. Maybe you’ll buy a new e-scooter or throw a Hawaiian luau next weekend. No one knows what you might do, but they sure would like to be part of it!</div><div><br></div><h1>Summing Up</h1><div><br>You can be interesting just by being yourself openly and unapologetically. You’re already a fascinating person. But if you want to be the <em>most</em> interesting person in the room, you’ll have to be a little bolder. Let the world see the real you. Let your crazy side out a little - You’re going to like the way you feel!</div><div><br><br></div><div></div>
