      <div>Hello Lisa Kathleen,&nbsp;</div><div><br>Thank you agreeing to speak to our group (VFN Professionals) this Wednesday! (NOTE: If you don’t have time to read this entire email - please skip ahead to the <strong>Set up </strong>section below)<br><br><strong>Who we are: </strong>In case Katherine has not already told you, we are a group of international families (200+ expats from around the world) living and working here in Vienna, Austria. We are a 100% volunteer organization seeking to support our members navigating the jungle of situations and decisions that arise for professionals with kids. As I learned from your webinars on the family framework, you are not a stranger to these circumstances either! <br>I am especially thrilled that both you &amp; Katherine have agreed to speak to our group, because while many people are have been wallowing in shock during these past weeks, both of you are part of the elite few who are not only finding creative ways to continue supporting and meeting the needs of your community, but you also rising above the challenge to reach out to connect with even more families around the world during this pandemic. Amazing! <br>Thank you so much. <br><br><strong>What I know about you:</strong>While I watched two of your webinars available on the family framework, I gathered that you are a highly accomplished professional, single mom &amp; expat. Is that correct? Here’s a summary I have:</div><ul><li>A self proclaimed ‘BIG parenting &amp; education nerd!’</li><li>In addition to her experience as a mom &amp; trained Montessori guide, she’s had her Own business - parenting coach &amp; parent educator &amp; she moved from Canada to California to join the guidepost team!</li><li>One of her Favorite Topic’s - supporting children through big feelings - &amp; she’s the first person in MY life who’s actually said, "I love whining!” without sarcasm!</li></ul><div><br><br></div><div><strong>What’s next?</strong></div><div>I am eager to work collaboratively with both of you, as much as possible without becoming a time burdon, to shine a spotlight on your work while bringing value to our listeners.&nbsp;</div><div>For promotional purposes, Katherine has already shared a short bio &amp; professional photo with me.&nbsp;</div><div><br><br></div><div>If you have ideas or input for structure / questions, that’s great! I welcome your ideas. Otherwise here is a structure that I’ve developed to direct the flow of conversation:</div><div><br><br></div><blockquote><strong>Welcome &amp; Intro </strong>ecm(5-10 min)<br><br><strong>Katherine - </strong>What we are doing/not doing</blockquote><ul><li>What has your experience been over these past few months?</li><li>How are you doing it all??? How are you managing the overwhelm? How are you deciding what you are doing and what you are letting go?</li><li>Can you offer us a Life lesson/ words for us to hold onto?</li><li>Intro guidepost (your school) &amp; family framework - Quick overview &amp; how to join/get info</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Lisa - </strong>How to actually do things</blockquote><ul><li>How did you manage nurturing both your own business &amp; daughter at home for so many years? What’s your secret?&nbsp;</li><li>Family framework: Tell us about your involvement. (Webinars, etc.)</li><li><del>What are the big struggles you hear from parents right now? What can they find in the family framework to support them?</del></li><li><del>Can you offer us a Life lesson/ words for us to hold onto?</del></li><li>During these times of change &amp; uncertainty, overwhelm and chaos - Many of us are left with a great big HOW? How can we do this? With their BIG feelings, with OUR big feelings? How can we actually do this? What are the principals, the mindset that we actually need to meet our children where we are all at - right now - during this pandemic? With all the BIG feelings?</li></ul><div><br><strong>Wrap up </strong>- ecm(3 min)<br><br><strong>Q&amp;A</strong>(5-7 min)Additionally, I would like to leave some time at the end for Q&amp;A, because I know our group will have questions.PLUS - We are already getting some questions from people who are registering!&nbsp;</div><ul><li>How to keep children busy on their own using no screens and engaging motor skills in the 3-6 year old range?</li><li>How to speak and explain the situation to children when you're also worried and stressed as a parent?</li></ul><blockquote><br><br><strong>Thank you &amp; goodbye</strong>(3 min)</blockquote><div><br><br></div><div><br><br></div><div><strong>Set up:</strong></div><div>All that remains is for us to meet online and make sure that everything is set up for our live webinar (about 10 minutes).</div><div>I am available to connect online everyday after 8pm. I believe you are in California which means we are 9 hours ahead. So, I can offer a window of availability between 11-3pm your time on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday.&nbsp;</div><div><br><br></div><div></div>
