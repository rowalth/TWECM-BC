</figure></bc-attachment>Example of a survey we sent out in an email P.S.</div><div>When creating your survey, avoid leading questions (e.g., “Why do you hate working out?”) and give clear examples of the types of answers you’re looking for, so that the reader knows how specific they need to be. And more important, ask for their name and email address so that you can follow up if necessary.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>This video from one of our product developers explains how to create the perfect customer survey.</div><div><br></div><div>When we send surveys, we aim for 100 responses.

I’ve already mentioned that you can surface some of these people from conducting surveys or posing a targeted question on social media. The best people are those who seem awfully riled up and emotionally charged about whatever it is you’re talking about. Just note the difference between:<br><br></div><div>“Hm, yeah, that’s an interesting idea.”<br><br></div><div>Versus…<br><br></div><div>“Oh my god, I’ve been researching that VERY thing for MONTHS and I still struggle with it!”<br><br></div><div>If the person feels as if it’s a pain in the ass to talk to you, you’re approaching the wrong people. Here’s a sample script to reach out and get them on a call with you:<br><br></div><div><em>Subject: Can I get your feedback?<br></em><br></div><div><em>Hi </em><strong><em>NAME</em></strong><em>,<br></em><br></div><div><em>I’m </em><strong><em>NAME</em></strong><em> and I am with &lt;your company name&gt;.<br></em><br></div><div><strong><em>CONTEXT ON HOW YOU FOUND THIS PERSON</em></strong><em>, e.g., Thanks for filling out our research survey last week.

The following questions work:<br><br></div><ul><li>What are the main things you’re focused on right now?&nbsp;</li><li>What’s the number one thing you’re struggling with?</li><li>What have you tried to solve that problem? What happened?</li><li>If you could wave a magic wand to solve this problem, what would that look like?&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Your objective with these calls is to clarify and guide yourself toward the problem in the market that you should solve. In the end, you put in all of this legwork to answer this ultimate burning question of:<br><br></div><div><strong>Do people actually want this? Is this particular market and product category worth pursuing?&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div>If in our research we find that the answer is no, we don’t just give up; we ask: What is the BETTER OPTION to pursue?&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>But if the research goes well and you home in on a huge problem worth solving, you’ll have the <em>oopmh</em> behind arriving at the best positioning for your product. Here’s a peek at our positioning document, which is the culmination of all our market research, including the problem customers face, their hopes, fears, and dreams, and how we can differentiate ourselves from the competition, for <em>Behind the Sales Email</em>:<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://2nf3ps3utn5423gcp614fel0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image2.png" width="1600" height="772"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

Validating the product&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You’ve found out that real people (we recommend <em>at least </em>five) are absolutely THRILLED about your potential product, so you quickly get to work to build it.<br><br></div><div>Slow your rollllllllll…!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You’ve merely confirmed that people want this particular problem SOLVED. In fitness, for example, there are dozens and dozens of ways to solve the problem of weight loss. You don’t know if your product is solving that problem with replicable, optimal results just yet, or if your positioning is absolutely resonating with the market.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>So you have to test it with what we call a “de-scoped” version of the product. That is, a simple, usable version of the product that will be tested by a small segment of your target market. Think of the de-scoped product as a “beta” that you can still charge a lower price for.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Let’s say you wanted to build a course on how to write a sales page (which we have!). Rather than spend the energy to create the entire course to test it, ask yourself: What would it look like if it were easy?<br><br></div><div>A two-day live webinar testing your planned content perhaps?<br><br></div><div>Yes, that’s good.<br><br></div><div>Or even simpler: an outline or a PDF to test a particular value proposition.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://2nf3ps3utn5423gcp614fel0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/giphy-1.gif" width="496" height="360"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><br></div><div>In fact, I made <a href="https://growthlab.com/youre-afraid-selling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">$5,000 off an OUTLINE that then turned into a beta</a>. I was able to do that with the following product validation method…<br><br></div><div><strong>Pre-selling the product to gauge interest</strong><br>I wanted to teach content-creating entrepreneurs and writers how to get their articles published in major recognizable publications. The problem I was solving? Not knowing who to talk to or how to pitch.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Before plunging into the six-week-long webinar series I’d envisioned, I created a simple four-page outline to show what people would learn. I was upfront about wanting to get a read on interest levels and that I was looking for beta testers.<strong> </strong>Then I went directly to prospects, and if they were interested, offered a one-time discount for joining the beta.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://2nf3ps3utn5423gcp614fel0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/22219349_10155082168742684_1876333389_o.png" width="1390" height="886"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment>Screenshot of the outline I created.</div><div>Going at it this way was low risk because if enough people were willing to pay (I made sure they paid me first), then I’d know I was onto something and could get to work on building the beta product. But if not, I could’ve refunded those who paid and went on my merry little way — no harm done.<br><br></div><div>In the end, 17 people paying me on the basis of an outline was enough validation to move forward with my beta.<br><br></div><div><strong>Hosting a paid webinar </strong><br>A paid webinar (or a live in-person workshop in some cases) is awesome if you feel confident about your product. Let’s say you wanted to create a course with eight modules (go you!). Rather than produce the full-fledged course, you can instead simplify with four modules and conduct live webinars, one per week for four weeks.<br><br></div><div>The benefits of validating your product this way:<br><br></div><ol><li>You still get paid to test whether your positioning resonates with your audience.&nbsp;</li><li>You get immediate feedback on which parts of your content work and which need improvement.</li><li>Based on reaction and feedback, you can keep refining and adding to the outline, videos, worksheets, and overall material until you knock it out of the park.</li></ol><div>At GrowthLab, we do paid webinars with limited seating and a lower price point to test our positioning and content before they become full-on courses. We typically launch these paid webinars to a select group of people that are within the product’s target market and even devise a full launch strategy for it.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://2nf3ps3utn5423gcp614fel0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-06-29-at-1.05.32-PM.png" width="1600" height="943"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">
