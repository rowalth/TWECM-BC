</figure></bc-attachment>No one style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">communication</a> is inherently better than another. But picking the wrong type of communication for a particular audience, whether it’s one person or a thousand, can negatively impact how your ideas and messages are received. Building communication flexibility allows you to customize your message to the preferred communication style(s) of your audience and ensures that your message is heard.<br><br></div><div>Now that you have your communication styles results, let’s dig deeper into each of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2015/08/06/which-of-these-4-communication-styles-are-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">four communication styles</a>: Analytical, Functional, Intuitive and Personal.<br><br></div><div>Here’s a quick overview of the four communication styles:<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Intuitive communicators</strong> are unemotional and freeform. They want bottom-line communications that are short and to the point and that don’t waste their time.</li><li><strong>Analytical communicators</strong> are unemotional but linear. They want confident communications that convey expertise including hard facts and numbers.</li><li><strong>Functional communicators</strong> are emotional and linear. They like to have control of the process, so give them process-oriented and linear communications that start at A, and then flow from B to C and all the way to Z.</li><li><strong>Personal communicators</strong> are emotional and freeform. They want to establish an interpersonal relationship, so use emotional language in an informal, friendly and warm way that gets them involved in talking about factors including who else will be involved and how what you’re asking them to do will impact their feelings.</li></ul><div>Remember that no one communication style is inherently better than another. The key to effective communication is using the verbal communication style that best ensures your message will be heard.<br><br></div><div>One major philosophical difference that separates the four communication styles is the extent to which you communicate with emotions or with data. For example, would you say something like “I feel like we’re off to a good start this quarter” (emotions), or would you say “this quarter, sales are up by 7.2%”(data).<br><br></div><div>Another major philosophical difference is the extent to which you communicate in a linear way (e.g. you like to start with A then B then C then D going all the way to Z) or in a freeform way (e.g. you like to skip over most of the details and jump right to Z).<br><br></div><div>Of course, there’s a lot more to the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90296536/these-are-4-styles-of-communication-that-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">four communication styles</a> than just these two philosophical differences. But as a starting point, these are emblematic of the myriad ways that we like to communicate. <br><br>Despite <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">studies</a> saying we spend up to 80% of our workday in meetings, on the phone, and responding to emails, <a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/communication-in-the-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">communication in the workplace</a> isn’t always easy. Or enjoyable.<br><br></div><div><br>In fact, a 2016 <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article found that <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/03/two-thirds-of-managers-are-uncomfortable-communicating-with-employees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">69% of managers say they’re uncomfortable communicating with employees</a>. (And you can only imagine that number is significantly higher when the roles are reversed!)<br><br></div><div><br>The majority of the pain of workplace encounters comes down to dealing with (and decoding) different communication styles. Dealing with people who speak differently than you is straight-up stressful. Not only does it waste time with all the clarifying back-and-forths, but it often leaves us feeling upset, angry, and overwhelmed.<br><br></div><div><br><br></div><div>Now let’s take a deeper dive…<br><br></div><div><br>The Analytical Communicator<bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0860/7364/files/Communication_Styles_Analytical_medium.png?v=1559345806" width="240" height="171"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment>As an Analytical communicator, you like communicating with hard data, real numbers, and you tend to be suspicious of people who aren’t in command of the facts and data. You typically like very specific language and dislike vague language. For example, when someone tells you that “sales are positive” you’re likely to think “What the heck does positive mean? Is it 5.2% or 8.9%? Give me a number!” People who naturally prefer an Analytical communication style often have little patience for communication that includes lots of feeling and emotional words.<br><br></div><div>One big plus of having an Analytical communication style is that because you like communication to be fairly unemotional, you’re often able to look at issues logically and dispassionately. This means others tend to see you as having high levels of data and informational expertise.<br><br></div><div>The potential downside of having an Analytical communication style is that you may strike certain people as being cold or unfeeling. For example, when interacting with people like Personal communicators (who tend to like warm and chatty personal relationships), it’s possible for Analytical communicators to get irritated and terse. This sometimes has negative political and relational consequences.<br><br></div><div><br>The Intuitive Communicator<bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0860/7364/files/Communication_Styles_Intuitive_medium.png?v=1559346006" width="240" height="173"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment>As an Intuitive communicator, you like the big picture, you avoid getting bogged down in details, and you cut right to the chase. You don’t need to hear things in perfect linear order but prefer instead a broad overview that lets you easily skip right to the end point. For example, some people, like Functional communicators, will tell you things step-by-step (they start with A, then go to B, then C, then D, then E, etc.). But this can drive you nuts; you’d rather jump right to Z.<br><br></div><div>One big plus of having an Intuitive communication style is that your communication is quick and to the point. You don’t get stalled by needing too many details, and you’re comfortable with big ideas and out-of-the-box thinking. Because you’re good with thinking big, you can also enjoy challenging convention.<br><br></div><div>The potential downside of having an Intuitive communication style is that you may not always have enough patience when you’re in a situation that actually requires getting into nitty-gritty detail (and you may risk missing an important point). Typically, Intuitive communicators have the most difficulty dealing with Functional communicators (those are the 'process-driven' people, they’re very methodical, walk through things step-by-step, and like nitty-gritty detail).<br><br></div><div><br>The Functional Communicator<bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0860/7364/files/Communication_Styles_Functional_medium.png?v=1559346036" width="240" height="173"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">
  <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0860/7364/files/Communication_Styles_Functional_medium.png?v=1559346036" width="240" height="173">

</figure></bc-attachment>As a Functional communicator, you like process, detail, timelines and well-thought-out plans. You like communicating in a step-by-step fashion so nothing gets missed. By contrast, there are some people, like the Intuitive communicators, who like to skip all the detail and just jump right to the end. But this can drive you nuts; especially when you think about all the important bits of information the Intuitive person is potentially missing.<br><br></div><div>One big plus of having a Functional communication style is that your communication generally hits all the details and nothing gets missed. When you’re on a team, people will often turn to you to be the implementer, because they have confidence in your love of process and detail. And because you’re focused on things like process and detail, you’re the person who is typically asked to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_advocate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">devil’s advocate</a>.<br><br></div><div>The potential downside of having a Functional communication style is that you may risk losing the attention of your audience, especially when you’re talking to Intuitive communicators (those are the 'big picture' people who skip to the end and don't get bogged down in too much detail).<br><br></div><div><br>The Personal Communicator<bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0860/7364/files/Communication_Styles_Personal_medium.png?v=1559346070" width="240" height="173"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">
  <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0860/7364/files/Communication_Styles_Personal_medium.png?v=1559346070" width="240" height="173">

</figure></bc-attachment>As a Personal communicator, you value emotional language and connection, and you use that as your mode of discovering what others are really thinking. You find value in assessing not just how people think, but how they feel. You tend to be a good listener and diplomat, you can smooth over conflicts, and you’re typically concerned with the health of your numerous relationships.<br><br></div><div>One big plus of having a Personal communication style is that your communication allows you to build deep personal relationships with others. People will often turn to you as the ‘glue’ that holds groups together. And you’re typically able to pick-up ‘vibes’ that others may miss because you’re attuned to the emotional aspect of communication.<br><br></div><div>The potential downside of having a Personal communication style is that you may occasionally be derided as ‘touchy-feely.’ For example, when dealing with Analytical communicators (people who like data, hard numbers, logical discussions, and dislike that 'warm-and-fuzzy' stuff), it’s possible for Personal communicators to become exasperated and emotionally upset.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>Choosing The Right Communication Style When Talking To The Boss<br><br></div><div>When it comes to professional communication and especially engaging in conversation with the boss, it’s important to note that most bosses are Intuitive communicators. Bosses are busy, so it’s not surprising that they want just enough details to get them up to speed and to get right to the bottom line. This is especially important when there are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NCNABXV/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tough messages</a> to deliver.<br><br></div><div>If short, pointed and unemotional Intuitive communication is not your preferred style, you may perceive the boss as having an impatient personality, which can hinder successful communication. For example, if you naturally gravitate towards process-driven, detailed communication (a Functional communicator), and you give your Intuitive boss point A, then point B, then point C, slowly and incrementally building to point Z, you are absolutely going to make the boss’s head explode, which means your message will go unheard.<br><br></div><div>This is why learning to communicate outside your preferred style is so important. Because when you know to give boss the bottom line, big picture view first, and you gain their buy-in, that’s when the boss will open up to hearing your other points.<br><br></div><div>Imagine that you’re giving your boss a presentation on ‘Ten Recommendations for Increasing Customer Experience on the Company Website.’<br><br></div><div>The mistake, if your boss is an Intuitive communicator, would be to march into that meeting and say something like this:<br><br></div><ol><li><em>“My thoughts on Recommendation number one is we revamp our sales funnel to take a consultative approach to the sales process. I suggest creating three distinct sales funnels that are based upon the customers' skill level: straight to shopping cart for professionals and a question/answer for novices.</em></li><li><em>Recommendation number two is we increase our testing and monitoring. We can do this by hosting user-testing days that let us observe our website users live and listen to them narrate their experience, so we know where people are having trouble and what their opinions are about the site.</em></li><li><em>Recommendation number three is to employ customer service surveys and have constant communication between our customer service department and our tech team…”</em></li></ol><div>I’m going to stop here because my head is already exploding and we’re only on recommendation number three!<br><br></div><div>Instead of irritating the boss with all that detail, what you want to do is get right to the endpoint by cutting to the chase and saying:<br><br></div><div><em>“I have the following ten recommendations for improving customer experience on our website. #1: take a consultative approach, #2: test and monitor, #3: customer surveys, #4: educate consumers, #5: interview users, #6: optimize language capabilities, #7: track what’s hot, #8: implement responsive web design, #9: determine calls to action and #10: make it more social. </em><strong><em>Please tell me which of these ten things you want to hear more about.”<br></em></strong><br></div><div>Presenting it this way allows the boss to pick and choose the recommendations they want to explore. So instead of negative body language, such as eye rolls and finger drumming and other non-verbal communication that tells you the boss isn't listening, you’re going to hear, “Number 3 sounds really interesting. Tell me more about that.” This gives you the chance to fill in the details while the boss actually listens. If you don’t have a list to work from, you can simply ask the boss, “What information would make this a good use of your time?”<br><br></div><div>Using a bit of emotional intelligence by speaking to the boss using the non-linear communication they prefer has multiple benefits. It puts an end to impatient behavior, builds the boss’s trust in you, showcases your competence in delivering the results the boss wants, and allows you to grow a fruitful and successful relationship with the boss.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>Communication Tips For Technology Professionals<br><br></div><div>Based on testing more than 50,000 people, we know that many technically gifted people are Analytical communicators. That is, they prefer data-focused communication that conveys confident expertise and provides hard facts and numbers with lots of specific supporting evidence.<br><br></div><div>The problem is, while you may be valued for your knowledge and skills as the technological expert on the team, those same two factors can make you appear superior, sarcastic or uncaring to others during interactions with those who are less technology savvy. You may even get accused of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2016/12/18/are-you-a-technical-genius-who-gets-accused-of-lacking-people-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">lacking people skills</a>. All this can shut down workplace communication with bosses, peers, coworkers and customers and prevent you from getting full credit for your brain talent.<br><br></div><div>When talking to other Analyticals, it’s fine to give real, specific data, but not everyone in your corporate culture responds well to that communication style. Learning to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/27/these-simple-tweaks-can-help-tech-experts-be-better-understood-at-work.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">adapt your Analytical style</a> to meet the communication needs of other types of communicators will allow you to relay messages that connect with and bring value to others without putting them on the defensive.<br><br></div><div>Outside of Analytical communicators, there are three other main styles you will encounter:<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Personal communicators</strong> prefer relationship-building communications that are supportive, warm, informal and conflict free. If you’re an Analytic communicator, Personal communicators will be your biggest challenge as they like to engage in the kind of communication you probably try your hardest to avoid. For example, these are the lovers of small talk and “feeling” words (e.g. mad, sad, angry, glad) and of asking questions such as: “Who else will be involved?” Analyticals and Personals use opposite measures and competencies to decide who they do and don’t want to communicate with. Practice and patience will help you master conversations with Personal communicators.</li><li><strong>Intuitive communicators</strong> prefer to skip the small talk and jump right to the bottom line. A good clue that you’re talking to an Intuitive is if they appear rushed or time conscious. When giving technological recommendations to Intuitives, it’s best to give it up front, before you go through reams of data. This will help gain their buy-in so you can then present your other points.</li><li><strong>Functional communicators</strong> prefer communications that follow a detailed “A thru Z” approach. These are process people and you’ll recognize them by the questions they ask including “What happens next?” Keeping your communications logical, disciplined and organized is the best way to reach Functional communicators.</li></ul><div>If you don’t know what style an individual is, all you have to do is ask: “What can I share with you today?” or “What would be of greatest value to you?” or “What would you like to hear?” and then listen for verbal indicators in the response.<br><br></div><div>For example, you might hear “Where’s the data from?” from your fellow Analyticals, “What’s the bottom line?” from the Intuitives, “What’s the process?” from the Functionals and “Who else is involved?” from the Personals.<br><br></div><div>As a technically gifted person, your job is probably providing support to less technical people, and this is a role where <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2017/07/09/if-you-want-to-be-an-empathic-listener-stop-using-this-word/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">listening</a> is an essential element of good communication. It’s not enough to just sit there and to take in what people say. Using this approach only allows you to capture 10% of the incoming information. And while asking “what seems to be the problem?” may seem an innocuous enough invite for them to speak and for you to listen, even the singular word “problem” can spike emotions and close off communication.<br><br></div><div>It's far more effective to ask questions that invite open communication. For example: “What issues can I help you with today?” If you need more information, or if you need to disagree, don’t risk paraphrasing. Instead, take a gentle approach by saying:<br><br></div><ul><li>I’m not sure I’m fully getting this…Can I share what I hear you saying?</li><li>I appreciate you sharing…I actually see things a bit differently…Can I share what I’m seeing?</li><li>Could you help me understand how you’ve come to this conclusion?</li><li>It sounds like there are some areas where we have some commonalities and some where we have some differences. Why don’t we start with the commonalities?</li></ul><div>Dialing back your communications helps you to get all the information you need because it makes the less technical feel served while you still maintain control. Following this script will keep you in good stead:<br><br></div><div><em>‘My job is to listen to you, gather some information and then help you with _____(diagnosis, fix the problem, etc.) Let’s talk for a few minutes about _____. Then we’ll see if there’s anything else you’d like to share, and then we’ll _____ (do test, move on, review, etc.) Does that sound ok?’<br></em><br></div><div>Outlining the steps you plan to take will help maintain transparency. For example, you might say “First I’m going to ask you some questions about the problems the computer is having. Then I’ll ask you about what steps you’ve taken so far. Then we’ll diagnosis some potential causes and try some fixes. Does that sound OK?” And above all, don’t ask potentially insulting questions like: “Have you tried plugging it in?”<br><br></div><div>Often the technologically smartest people don’t have matching skills for interacting with other human beings. If your technical competence outweighs your ability to communicate and connect with other people, bring yourself down just a bit so that others can catch up with you.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>How To Talk To People That Don’t Get Right To The Point<br><br></div><div>Have you ever been had a conversation with someone who went through a plan in such painstaking detail that your brain started to hurt? Getting every nitty-gritty little step when all you really want is to cut-to-the-chase and get to you the bottom line is painful.&nbsp; Or maybe it was the other way around, you needed to hear all the detail, but all you got was the bottom line. These kinds of struggles are one of the reasons why the critical skill of <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/283844" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">good office</a> communication often goes ignored.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Over two decades of research into communication styles shows that conflicts between people with an Intuitive communication style and those with a Functional communication style (exemplified by the two situations described above) are one of the biggest <a href="https://www.leadershipiq.com/blogs/leadershipiq/%3Cp%3E%C2%A0%3C/p%3E%20%3Cp%3Ehttps://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2017/04/09/how-to-talk-to-people-that-dont-get-right-to-the-point/%3C/p%3E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">communication conflict issues</a> that happen in the workplace.<br><br></div><div><br>Intuitive Vs. Functional Communication Styles<br><br></div><div>Intuitive communicators like the big picture and avoid getting bogged down in details; they cut right to the chase. Because they communicate in a non-linear way, they don’t need to hear things in perfect linear order but prefer instead a broad overview that lets them skip right to the end point. For example, some people, like Functional communicators, will tell you things step-by-step (they start with A, then go to B, then C, then D, then E, etc.). But this can drive Intuitive communicators nuts; they’d rather jump right to Z.<br><br></div><div>By contrast, Functional communicators like process, detail, timelines and well-thought-out plans. They like to communicate things in a step-by-step fashion, so nothing gets missed.<br><br></div><div>It’s easy to see why Functional communicators, who like to communicate step-by-step, can drive Intuitive communicators nuts, and vice versa. But while the conflict is very real, neither of these communication styles is better than the other; they each have strengths.<br><br></div><div>One big benefit of the Intuitive communication style is not getting bogged-down in too many details, allowing these communicators greater comfortability with big ideas and out-of-the-box thinking. One big benefit of having a Functional communication style is that communication generally hits all the details, and nothing gets missed. Colleagues will often turn to Functionals to take the lead in project implementation and execution because they have confidence in the Functionals’ talent for process and detail.<br><br></div><div><br>What Does The Data Say About These Communication Styles?<br><br></div><div>More than 67,000 people have taken the free online quiz called “What's Your Communication Style?” And based on this immense data set, we know that about 21% of people have a Functional communication style and roughly 24% have an Intuitive communication style. But notwithstanding this almost-even split, we’re more likely to see the Intuitive style in very senior executive roles.<br><br></div><div>The good news is that whether you’re the boss or an employee, there’s an easy fix for resolving these maddening communication conflicts. Let’s take a look at both scenarios.<br><br></div><div><br>What To Do When Your Employees Take Too Long To Get To The Point<br><br></div><div>When you’re the boss and it’s one of your employees that’s taking too long to get to the point, you can handle this pretty quickly. Instead of audibly sighing and saying, “can you please just hurry up and get to the point?” you’re going to teach them a little bit about your preferred communication style.<br><br></div><div>This can be done by saying something like the following:<br><br></div><div><em>“We have different communication styles, and that’s okay. But I do think we can work together even more effectively. You’re a Functional communicator; that means you like to communicate things in a step-by-step fashion, so nothing gets missed. By contrast, I have an Intuitive communication style, so I like a broad overview that lets me skip right to the end point. Going forward, what I’d like is for us to accommodate each other’s preferred style. So next time you have a plan, give me the end point first. Cut right to the bottom-line, give me ‘Z’ and skip the ‘A, B, C, D’ detail. Then because I’ll have gotten what I really need, you’ll find me a bit more willing to listen to some of the other ‘A, B, C, D’ details.”<br></em><br></div><div>Even though you’re the boss, and you have the formal authority to make people communicate however you want, there’s no need to do this rudely. Just teach your folks how you like to receive information and you’ll generally find them much more attuned to your Intuitive communication style.<br><br></div><div><br>What To Do When Your Boss Takes Too Long To Get To The Point<br><br></div><div>If you’re an Intuitive communicator and your boss has a Functional communication style, it’s just not going to work for you to audibly sigh and say, “can you please just hurry up and get to the point?”<br><br></div><div>Instead, you’re going to need some patience and understanding. First, know that your boss is not rambling or slow-minded; they’re just detail oriented. And one big reason why bosses adopt a Functional communication style with their employees is that they’re worried that those around them will miss an important detail. In fact, if they know that you’re a cut-to-the-chase person, they may be giving you lots of details because they think you’re likely to miss an important point. And they’re nicely trying to tell you to pay more attention to the details.<br><br></div><div>So the next time the boss is giving you lots of detail, pull out notepad and pen and literally start taking notes. Pay attention to all those details and then, when they’ve downloaded everything, give them a quick recap to show you’ve heard the key details. But don’t do the normal Intuitive thing and start at the end; start back at point number one and go forward from there.<br><br></div><div>This takes some work, but after a few sessions of this, when you’ve demonstrated to the boss that you really do hear all their details, you’ll typically find that they’ll dial-down a bit on the nitty-gritty and your conversations will proceed more quickly.<br><br><br>Quick reports:<br><br>1. <strong>ANALYTICAL: LOVERS OF HARD DATA AND CLEARLY DEFINED TASKS<br></strong><br>Advantages: Speed - communication is largely logical and unemotional, which can speed things up - usually confident expertise and provides hard facts and numbers with lots of specific supporting evidence.<br>Disadvantage - might come across as cold and aggressive when someone wants to talk about anything beyond just getting from A to B.<br><br></div><div>The problem is, while you may be valued for your knowledge and skills as the technological expert on the team, those same two factors can make you appear superior, sarcastic or uncaring to others ESPECIALLY during interactions with those who are less technology savvy. You may even get accused of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2016/12/18/are-you-a-technical-genius-who-gets-accused-of-lacking-people-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">lacking people skills</a>, uncaring, rude. All this can shut down communication with bosses, peers, coworkers and customers - pretty much anyone that you're communicating with who is NOT an analytical communicator like you and prevent you from getting their full ear and credit for your brain talent. Which is frustrating &amp; unfair - not really what you want, is it?<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><br>2. <strong>INTUITIVE: THE BIG-PICTURE THINKERS<br></strong><br>Advantage: Speed - a conversation that needs a quick answer. Or if you’re looking for out-of-the-box approaches to issues. Your intuition / gut drives your decision making &amp; you don't get bogged down in analyasis paralasis! <br><br>Disadvantage: Sometimes nuance and subtlety do matter, &amp; your style can come across as rough &amp; even aggressive- which does not help the situation at all. Even if what you are saying / proposing IS actually the best solution... people's ears are closed to what you have to say. Which is EXACTLY WHAT YOU DON'T WANT!<br><br>3. <strong>FUNCTIONAL: DEALING WITH EVERYTHING ONE STEP AT A TIME<br></strong><br>advantage: Guiding / leading For project managers or leaders, knowing all necessary steps puts you in a position to guide and lead.&nbsp;<br><br>disadvantage: makes you come across as a bit of a bore. Nothing makes an audience doze off like constantly digging into details and dealing with every project like it’s a grocery list, even though you &amp; I both know that focusing on the details is necessary and they ARE important, but a bored audience glosses over the details and builds negative feeling to the whole project - THE OPPOSITE of what you want!</div><div><br>4. <strong>PERSONAL: RELATIONSHIPS OVER INFORMATION EXCHANGE<br></strong>advantages: You value connection, relationships, and emotional language - this is your comfort zone and how you understand the world. You’re a good listener. Great diplomat. And when issues pop up due to the hard-lined communication styles of others - you are often the one who can help smooth things over.<br><br></div><div>You’re often seen as the “glue” that holds a team together. You build strong relationships and see communication as a chance to get to know people rather than just facts/figures &amp; move a project forward.<br><br></div><div>disadvantage: Unfortunately, this doesn’t go over well with everyone. Sometimes other people just don't get it, can become defensive or frustrated when a conversation turns into “feels.” - which is the EXACT OPPOSITE of what you want!<br><br></div><div><br>So that's a quick overview of your communication style assessment - <br>now as promised, I'm giving you quick, actionable steps so that you can turn your natural communication style into a true super power - in 3 steps:<br>1. What are your results - post it below, how closely does the description match you? Are you 125% Analytical - or a mix of two or three. Yes, I know some of you have taken this quiz multiple times - it's fun isn't it? But beyond the fun bit, I really want to give you the tools to improve your communication skills - today. So Let me know your results &amp; I'll give you personalized feedback!<br><br>2.

      <div>Who works in your office?<br>Research shows us people have four different styles of communicating. We call these styles: <strong>Director, Expresser, Thinker and Harmonizer</strong>. Each style has its own way of seeing the world. Each favors a certain way of listening, responding, making decisions, and solving problems.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>Most people use two styles more frequently than the others; this blend determines how you communicate. It’s especially important to understand your primary style, since this is the one you use most often. No style is any better than the others, but it may be to your advantage to play up one style over another, depending on the situation.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Key characteristics of each major style are shown in the chart below.</strong><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://cdn.business2community.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Four-Styles.png" width="692" height="528"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment><br><br></div><div>Because people have different styles, chances are that within any team or work group there will be <strong>conflicting approaches</strong>. Before team members can work together effectively, they need to be aware of these potential conflicts. They need to master certain tools to minimize these conflicts.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Exercise: Identify a Colleague’s Primary Communication Style<br></strong><br></div><div>The chart below will help you sort through another person’s style. Circle each behavior that applies, then total the number of squares you circled in each column. The two columns that get the highest scores will tell you that person’s preferred styles of communicating.<bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://cdn.business2community.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/identifying-communication-styles.png" width="738" height="358"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment><br><br></div><div>Once you’ve circled two styles at the bottom of the chart, use the next chart to determine a person’s primary style.<bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://cdn.business2community.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/identifying-communication-styles-2.png" width="398" height="298"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment><br><br></div><div><strong><br>3 Steps to Identify Communication Styles<br></strong><br></div><div>When meeting someone for the first time, there are three things to do:<br><br></div><ol><li><strong>Ask Questions</strong></li><li><strong>Observe Reactions</strong></li><li><strong>Listen Actively</strong></li></ol><div>My goal is to size someone up within five minutes. Ask a question like: “What do you do to stay current with trends in your business?” Or: “What kind of person is successful in your field?”<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Then watch for clues.<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>An <strong>asserter</strong> will instantly give you a response, and typically won’t ask whether you agree.</li><li>An <strong>inquirer</strong>, on the other hand, will say what he or she thinks, and then ask a genuine question: “That’s just my sense of it. What’s your opinion?”</li><li>A person who focuses on <strong>feelings</strong> will talk about the quality of the people he or she works with and their ability to meet whatever challenges lie ahead.</li><li>A more <strong>fact-oriented</strong> person will talk about studies or numbers or industry trends.</li></ul><div>You can’t rely on just one question. You’ve got to ask two or three to be sure. Weigh the number of times the person talks about feelings. Weigh the balance of inquiry and assertion.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Here are some questions that work well:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>How do you spend your free time, when you have some?</li><li>What do you like to read?</li><li>What did you study in school?</li></ul><div><strong><br>Watch how people interact with you.<br></strong><br></div><div>Do they engage in small talk? Or do they cut to the chase? Do they tell stories? Do they break an issue down into its constituent parts? Do they ask questions? Each of these is a trademark of a particular style.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Practice Observing<br></strong><br></div><div>In assessing a person’s style, <strong>observe the role</strong> that person is playing. A manager may feel she has to be assertive. It’s her job. But is she assertive by nature, or just playing the part? The balance of inquiry and assertion will tell you. The same thing is true of someone in a subordinate role. Is he probing by nature or because it’s required of him? There’s no simple key that will yield the correct answer every time. You simply have to practice observing.<br><br></div><div>Another trick is learning to recognize the<strong> assertive questioner</strong>. Some people temper their nature by disguising statements as questions. I recall a CEO who never asked: <em>“When would your schedule permit?”</em> She said:<em> “Could you be here next week?”</em> She laid out her desire very clearly – but tried to soften it by asking a question.<br><br></div><div>You’ll also learn to recognize the opposite: the</div><div>&nbsp;<strong>passive asserter</strong>. <em>“We’ve got a really good team here, and it’s taken a long time to build it. It’s very important here at XYZ Corp. that we have a good team.”</em> On its own, that statement means relatively little. Certainly no one’s going to challenge it. It is utterly safe and benign. It is a passive assertion.</div><div>Asserters like to run the show; probers defer to others and ask questions. Asserters leap to conclusions and take risks; probers look for confirmation and safety in numbers. Be attuned to the situation. An asserter may appear passive at first. But put him or her in a situation that requires someone to take charge, and a different style may emerge.<br><br></div><blockquote><strong><br>Observe where people invest their attention.<br></strong><br></blockquote><div>Do they talk about their family, or about their new car? If they tend to say things are “good” or “bad,” that’s the mark of the feeler. If their judgments are cast more in the words “right” and “wrong,” that’s a sign of a factual style. Again, you have to be careful not to be tricked by the situation. A person you know from church may have an entirely different style at work.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Conclusion<br></strong><br></div><div>By tuning yourself to identify and understand each style, you’ll quickly learn to appreciate some of the subtleties in people’s communications – the hidden levels of meaning behind what they say, the types of things they pay attention to. This, in turn, will lead to more satisfying and more successful interactions. More important, as you begin to appreciate how people see things in four very different ways, you begin to appreciate how around us revolve four different worlds – the worlds of the <strong>Director, Expresser, Thinker and Harmonizer.<br></strong></div>

Who is around you?<br>So you know your communication style &amp; as long as you are talking with someone who uses the same style as you - life is great...but life doesn't work that way. You have your style and other people have theirs, and you can't &amp; you shouldn't change that. you are who you are, never change that, BUT with a few simple tools you can use your own communication super powers to figure out what other people need from you so that they can give you the information that you want from them. Success comes down to our ability to communicate in a way that’s clear, concise, and understood by everyone - not just those who think like us.<br>AND by understanding our own communication style and those of the people around us, we get invaluable clarity into how to be heard (and how to hear what everyone else is saying).&nbsp;<br>So, how to quickly assess others - without making them take this quiz, share link &lt;3&nbsp;<br>Quick test:</div><ol><li><strong>Ask Questions - </strong>What’s one thing that I could share with you today, that would make this a great use of your time?<br>(listen for communication type!)</li><li><strong>Observe Reactions</strong></li><li><strong>Listen Actively to get clues</strong></li></ol><ul><li>An <strong>asserter</strong> will instantly give you a response, and typically won’t ask whether you agree.</li><li>An <strong>inquirer</strong>, on the other hand, will say what he or she thinks, and then ask a genuine question: “That’s just my sense of it.

      <div>4 types:<br><br><strong>1. Analytical - Love facts, hard data, specific language = clarity</strong><br>+Speed: communication is logical and unemotional<br>-you might come across as cold, unfeeling, lacking people skills <br>! communication is a necessary part of being human - whether your talking with bosses, peers, coworkers, customers...it is important not to shut down communication on either side and risk prevent you from getting full credit for your brain talent &amp; the hard work that you did. <strong>That is completely frustrating &amp; unfair - no one wants that, right?<br></strong><br><strong>2. Intuitive - Big Picture thinkers</strong><br>+quick decisions / out-of-the-box approaches to issues<br>-sometimes nuance, subtlety &amp; feelings DO matter - risk coming across as too assertive, directive - even bossy/ uncaring. I bet you can think of a times when even if your idea/approach/solution IS the best, risk people listening &amp; reacting more HOW you say something rather than WHAT you say. <strong>Which is the EXACT OPPOSITE of what you want! </strong><br><br><strong>3. FUNCTIONAL: DEALING WITH EVERYTHING ONE STEP AT A TIME - </strong>you it's all about the PROCESS<br>+Leadership - guiding / leading knowing all necessary steps<br>- boring - Nothing makes an audience doze off like constantly digging into details and dealing with every project in long tedious lists. <br>! details ARE important - can't be glossed over - <strong>THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU WANT, but catching those details only works if the people are actually listening</strong><br><br><strong>4. Personal: relationships are key</strong><br>+You value connection, relationships &amp; emotional language. You’re a good listener. Great diplomat. And when more hard-lined communication brings up issues, you are often the one who can help smooth things over. The glue that holds the team together!<br>-Not always valued or even received well, others can become annoyed / defensive / frustrated when a conversation turns to 'feels'<br>! <strong>this is the EXACT OPPOSITE of what you want!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></strong>Quick reports:<br><br>1. <strong>ANALYTICAL: LOVERS OF HARD DATA AND CLEARLY DEFINED TASKS<br></strong><br>Advantages: Speed - communication is largely logical and unemotional, which can speed things up - usually confident expertise and provides hard facts and numbers with lots of specific supporting evidence.<br>Disadvantage - might come across as cold and aggressive when someone wants to talk about anything beyond just getting from A to B.<br><br></div><div>The problem is, while you may be valued for your knowledge and skills as the technological expert on the team, those same two factors can make you appear superior, sarcastic or uncaring to others ESPECIALLY during interactions with those who are less technology savvy. You may even get accused of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2016/12/18/are-you-a-technical-genius-who-gets-accused-of-lacking-people-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">lacking people skills</a>, uncaring, rude. All this can shut down communication with bosses, peers, coworkers and customers - pretty much anyone that you're communicating with who is NOT an analytical communicator like you and prevent you from getting their full ear and credit for your brain talent. Which is frustrating &amp; unfair - not really what you want, is it?<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><br>2. <strong>INTUITIVE: THE BIG-PICTURE THINKERS<br></strong><br>Advantage: Speed - a conversation that needs a quick answer. Or if you’re looking for out-of-the-box approaches to issues. Your intuition / gut drives your decision making &amp; you don't get bogged down in analyasis paralasis! <br><br>Disadvantage: Sometimes nuance and subtlety do matter, &amp; your style can come across as rough &amp; even aggressive- which does not help the situation at all. Even if what you are saying / proposing IS actually the best solution... people's ears are closed to what you have to say. Which is EXACTLY WHAT YOU DON'T WANT!<br><br>3. <strong>FUNCTIONAL: DEALING WITH EVERYTHING ONE STEP AT A TIME<br></strong><br>advantage: Guiding / leading For project managers or leaders, knowing all necessary steps puts you in a position to guide and lead.&nbsp;<br><br>disadvantage: makes you come across as a bit of a bore. Nothing makes an audience doze off like constantly digging into details and dealing with every project like it’s a grocery list, even though you &amp; I both know that focusing on the details is necessary and they ARE important, but a bored audience glosses over the details and builds negative feeling to the whole project - THE OPPOSITE of what you want!</div><div><br>4. <strong>PERSONAL: RELATIONSHIPS OVER INFORMATION EXCHANGE<br></strong>advantages: You value connection, relationships, and emotional language - this is your comfort zone and how you understand the world. You’re a good listener. Great diplomat.
