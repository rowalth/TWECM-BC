      <div>Here's a list of sample email scripts to help get you started. Use these as launch pads to create your own winning emails.<br>Copy the information in the emails and edit to your specific situation. I recommend that you add your own personalized touches so that the email sounds both friendly and professional. <br><br>The most important thing here is to focus on making the other person feel good and make it easy for them to say yes. No one likes to feel awkward or pressured to help someone they don't even know.<br><br><br><strong>WARM EMAILS - </strong><br>Writing to people you already know, or at least have had some contact with.<br><br><strong><br>Email:​ </strong>Request an introduction from someone you know</div><div><br>Hi (name),<br>I hope you’re having a great week!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Last week I drove by our old school and it made me think of you. It’s been awhile since we’ve caught up, let’s plan a coffee date soon! <br><br><del>Your recent post on LinkedIn really sparked my attention. It is so exciting to see how companies and schools are working together to welcome more women into the tech industry. &nbsp;</del></div><div><br></div><div>Additonally, I wanted to let you know that I’ve been thinking about making a move to the (name your industry) and I noticed that you have some great connections. Would you be comfortable introducing me to (desired contact) at (company)? I’d love to talk to her about her role in the company and her work with (project name). If you wish, I’m happy to write up and send an introduction email to you so that you can simply copy and paste it.<br><br></div><div>Thank you in advance for your consideration!&nbsp;<br>Also, please let me know when you’re available for that coffee date. I’m looking forward to catching up!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Best, (name)&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>How to ask for recommendations for people to talk to<br></strong><br></div><blockquote>Hello (name),<br><br>Hope all is well.<br><br>If you recall, we spoke a few months ago at (event) when I was exploring new career opportunities in (industry). Thanks again for (how they helped you).<br><br>I was browsing the (company) site the other day and the (job) caught my eye. I think it’d be perfect for me considering my work experience with (example).<br><br>From what I remember, it sounds pretty similar to the work you do at (company). By any chance, do you know of anyone there that you think I should talk with? I’d love to learn more about the role so I can see if it’s the right fit for me.<br><br>If not, no problem — just wanted to keep you in the loop. Thanks again for all your help!<br><br>Take care,<br>(name)</blockquote><div><br><br></div><div>Follow up email:<br>I think sending a short email letting them know that you appreciate their contact/help/advice/whatever they gave you &amp; that you sent the application as suggested is a good idea. People generally feel good knowing that someone actually listened &amp; followed their suggestions :)<br><br>Something like this:&nbsp;<br>Hello (name),<br>Just wanted to thank you again for talking with me at [name of event]. I sent my CV to (name) as you recommended. I’ll keep you in the loop, and of course, please let me know if there’s anything I can do to repay the favor!<br>Best,<br>(name)</div><div><br><br><strong>COLD EMAILS - </strong><br>Writing to people you don't know, and don't have any known contacts in common.<br><strong><br>Email:​ </strong>Request a meeting (from someone you don’t know)&nbsp;</div><div><br>Hi (name),<br>I hope you’re having a great week!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>I found your profile on LinkedIn and was impressed with your (background/acomplishment). I’m a (job title) at (company or location) and I’m looking to further develop my career.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Right now I’m in the research phase of my job search and I was wondering if you’d be available for a quick call to talk about your experience at (company).&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>I’m looking forward to hearing from you!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Best,<br>(name)<br><br><strong>SUBJECT: (school name) student will be in (city) next week - coffee?<br></strong><br><br>Hi (name),<br><br><br>My name is (name) and I'm at student at (university), where I study (subject).&nbsp; I'll be in (city) next month and was wondering -- can I take you to coffee?<br><br><strong><br>[CONTACT #1] and [CONTACT #2] </strong>actually suggested I get in touch.

I’m really interested in getting into [the field they work in] role at [the type of organization they work at, and I would love to hear your story. If yes, do any of these times work for you: [times] Happy to meet at other times too if something else works better.”<br><br>“Fifteen minutes of your time for advice would impact years of my life. I wonder if we could meet”<br>“I’d love to talk about what has made you successful.<br><br>“I have three specific questions on (topic) that I would love to get your insight on over a cup of coffee.

You’d interviewed me a little over 3 years ago–despite a lack of experience, you admired my industry savvy and overall spunk. I’ve kept up with your blog since then and noticed you made a move over to (new role) at (company).<br><br></div><div>I’ve love to hear your take on the future of (industry) for 15-20 minutes, if at all possible.
