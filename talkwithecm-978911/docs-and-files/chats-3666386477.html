      <div>I might be able to help too...depending on his exact situation. You mentioned "unmotivated &amp; possibly depressed." As an international - I get that. After moving &amp; reestablishing myself in 5 different cities on 3 different continents, ugg I know the struggle. I'm guessing there could be quite a bit of frustration and possibly some inner critic self sabotage??&nbsp;</div><div>I am a conversation advocate - and master of meaningful small talk. My focus is empowering high level professionals to confidently speak out and get to YES - knowing exactly what to say and when to say it - without fake smiles or lame-o scripts.&nbsp;</div><div>And, as for why you should listen to me over the countless other voices in the world of business and shameless self-promotion let me give you the short answer (because we are all busy)</div><div>I have worked with oodles of international women and men and helped them go from feeling intimidated and over looked to being THE sought after expert in their field, who knew exactly what to say and how to say it without stumbling for words, lame scripts or fake smiles. And they rave about the fact that they can now confidently walk into any room, and effortlessly strike up a conversation - even with complete strangers - and easily talk about themselves / their business / their product with clarity and spark the genuine interest of others.&nbsp;</div><div>The reason I do this work is because I absolutely love it. I love being able to help busy professionals build their brand - find the right words with the right tone to present themselves with ease and power. I love empowering others to conquer their own inner critic and use their voice, and their own words to establish themselves and completely overcome imposter syndrome.&nbsp;</div><div>I show people how to go from not being able to explain what they do (without watching people's eyes gloss over) to knowing exactly when and how to engage and intrigue others with magnetic attraction. Plus I offer tools to enter negotiations with complete confidence and frameworks to reach that ultimate surge of getting a big YES when it really matters.</div><div>Verbal branding (especially personal branding) &amp; conquering your inner critic are my JAM!&nbsp;</div><div>If he's interested in having a talk with me - drop me a PM</div>
