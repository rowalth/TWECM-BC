As a <strong>working mum</strong> of two, I get it.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>I'm a career and leadership coach now, but I spent years working in corporate environments in HR and recruitment, so, believe me, I know!<br><br></div><div><strong>The Journey<br></strong><br></div><div>First, you fall pregnant and you're so excited.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You announce the wonderful news, but suddenly, you’re not getting the exciting projects you were pre-pregnancy, potentially impacting your career.<br><br></div><div>But, without giving it too much thought, you go off on maternity leave and when you return everything has changed.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>You have a new boss, a new desk, new colleagues, a new team and so on.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Things have moved on.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>The Struggle<br></strong><br></div><div>So, you try to keep up and manage it all but that time between drop-off and pick-up seems to fly.<br><br></div><div>And, if you can’t meet deadlines and manage stakeholders in those precious hours, being a successful <strong>working mum</strong> starts to seem impossible.<br><br></div><div>You feel like you're barely keeping your head above water.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>And then you fall pregnant again.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You have your second baby and you have to do it all over again, but this time, it's more intense.<br><br></div><div>It's more demanding on your body and your mind, but you persist, you get through it, because you’re a survivor.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>And then you finally get back on track and refocus on your career, because your kids are now more independent.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Self-Sabotage<br></strong><br></div><div>But there's something missing, you feel lost, as though you're not as relevant anymore and you feel invisible.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Colleagues are bypassing you to the career of their dreams and you don't know how to get your momentum back.<br><br></div><div>It’s an awful feeling, but you are not alone, and in fact, a lot of all of this is within your control.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Your belief that you’ve become less relevant is stopping you from getting back on the horse and achieving your potential.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Yes, you might have put your career on hold but that doesn't mean you've lost your skills and experience.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>It doesn’t mean you have nothing to offer an organisation anymore or that you’re somehow less capable in the workplace.<br><br></div><div>Many of my <strong>working mum</strong> clients say, “I have to accept a lower salary because my skills aren’t current anymore.”&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>However, it only takes six to eight weeks to get back up to speed with things after a career break.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>And then you're stuck with a job you accepted for 10-20k less than you’re worth.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Getting Help<br></strong><br></div><div>So, the message I want to share with you, fellow <strong>working mums</strong>, is this: you are not alone.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The struggle of the <strong>working mum</strong> is real and I’m on that very same journey with you.<br><br></div><div>But we have to start standing up for ourselves and value what we can contribute and achieve.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Together we can make this happen but you need to realise you are not insignificant.<br><br></div><div>You have skills and experience that can contribute to making a massive difference to an organisation.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You have to shift your mindset and believe you can do it and that you’ll make an impact, but it all starts with you.<br><br></div><div>If you need help piecing it all together, don't be afraid to reach out for help.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>As a <strong>working mum</strong> who gets it, I'm here for you, so don’t hold yourself back, <a href="https://www.newhorizoncoaching.com.au/call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">book a call</a>with me and together we can get your career back on track.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Whatever you want to achieve, we will create a plan, a strategy to make that happen.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Please like and share this message with any <strong>working mums</strong> you know<strong>, </strong>because I would love to help.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>ABOUT ME<br></strong><br></div><div>Hi, I'm Caroline De Kimpe, Career &amp;
