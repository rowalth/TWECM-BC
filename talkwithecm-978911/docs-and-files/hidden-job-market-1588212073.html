      Hidden Job Market

      <div>Quiz:<br>What is the hidden job market?<br>It includes:<br>-Jobs that are announced publicly, but not promoted widely<br>-Jobs that organisations hide from the public &amp; filled by referrals only<br>-Jobs that are never publicised anywhere<br>-All of the above<br><br><br>(answer is all of the above)<br><br>What kinds of jobs are there?</div><blockquote><strong>Why Would a Job Be Hidden?</strong><br>Ultimately, employers want to hire people they know, like, and trust. Receiving applications, resumes, and conducting interviews are great ways for employers to get to know job candidates, but it’s also a time-consuming process. For an employer, the search for a potential employee begins well before they post a job. It might include figuring out what skills and experience are necessary for the job, writing a job description, and setting salary and benefit options with their finance and human resource staff.<br><br>There may be good reasons why an employer doesn’t post or advertise a job. Employers will leverage networks for a number of reasons.&nbsp; They oftentimes have an immediate need to fill a position, and the cycle time to find a candidate through an online posting is relatively long. Consider these scenarios:<br><br></blockquote><ul><li><blockquote>An employer needs to find a replacement for a sales representative who works on many client or business accounts. They want to find a qualified applicant and use a search firm to confidentially find candidates.</blockquote></li><li><blockquote>An employer is hiring for several positions that will develop and launch a new product line. They don’t want to advertise their openings because it will reveal their plans to their competitors, so they use online tools like <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> to recruit candidates.</blockquote></li><li><blockquote>A small employer needs to replace a long-time employee who is retiring. Instead of posting the job opening, they ask their current employees for referrals.<br><br>• Cost and time reduction.<br><br>• Helps to keep a company's hiring decisions as quiet as possible.<br><br>• Acquires suitable candidates through employee referral. The employees understand the needs of the job and have a vested interest in recommending the good candidate.<br><br>• Provides a bonus option to employees who recommend the applicant who is hired.</blockquote></li></ul><div><br></div><blockquote>Beginning right now, you are cordially invited to enter the hidden job market and stop putting your career in the hands of keyword-searching algorithms and bureaucratic systems.</blockquote><div><br></div><blockquote>The #1 reason to aim for a hidden job<br><br>Competition for advertised, non-hidden jobs is tougher as more people fight for a smaller number of openings than what are really available.<br><br>Put differently- if you can find a relevant hidden job opening, you’ll have much fewer candidates to compete with for the position, if any at all.<br><br>Sounds tempting, I know.</blockquote><div><br></div><div>So where are the hidden jobs?<br><br></div><div><br><br>How to uncover the hidden job market?<br>Connect with - in house recruiters, decision makers, external headhunters<br><br></div><ol><li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2014/07/17/how-to-write-your-human-voiced-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Brand yourself</a> for the jobs and/or engagements you want -- not every job you could possibly perform</li><li>Make a list of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2014/07/25/how-to-create-a-target-employer-list-for-your-job-search/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Target Employers/Clients</a></li><li>Research your target firms to find "your" hiring manager in each one -- the person who will have the type of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2014/03/10/the-job-seekers-guide-to-business-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Business Pain</a> you solve, and if the pain is serious enough, also the money to solve it</li><li>Reach out to each of your hiring managers with a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2017/05/18/how-to-write-a-pain-letter-step-by-step/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pain Letter</a> that talks about pain and solutions, and</li><li>Begin to network like crazy -- not in your job-seeker persona but in a consulting persona instead</li></ol><div><br></div><div></div>
