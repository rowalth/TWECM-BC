I get a lot of questions, and I’d like to share my responses here with you. I want to see how this all works - if I like it, if you like it. Let’s see!<br><br>So, here’s today’s question:<br><br>How can I find advanced variety topics to start conversation with my colleagues ?<br><br>This is from Islam<br><br>Thanks for your question&nbsp;<br>It's a really good question and a topic that many people struggle with - conversation topics!<br><br>Think about it:<br><br>Maybe you're sitting around the table, waiting for the meeting to start...but you don't know what to talk about.<br><br>Or you join your colleagues for an after work party...but you're not sure how to strike up a conversation outside of work topics.<br><br>Or perhaps small talk is not a problem, but you want to move beyond meaningless chit-chat, connect on a personal level and add real value!<br><br>So, you are looking for advanced topics to start conversations with your colleagues - this is a good question, because you are very specific about the exact context - your colleagues, or people that you see often. But before we start jumping into solutions...I want to dig a little deeper, to help get a clearer image of the exact situation. Here are a few questions to help:<br><br>- What are you currently doing to start conversations with your colleagues?&nbsp;<br>- How do you feel in that exact moment?&nbsp;<br><br>Knowing these answers will help zero in on the best (&amp; most sustainable!) solution for you!<br><br>In general, to get really great conversation topics for a specific group of people, it is important to do a bit of pre-work. That is, a bit a research to set yourself up BEFORE you even start speaking. From your question, I know that you are ready to take that step.&nbsp;<br><br>Here is a 3 part technique to really listen in an connect with others that I use, my clients are using and I recommend for you:<br><br>1. Listen - Before jumping in and trying to be the center of attention, take some time to sit back and listen. What are people talking about? Which topics are interesting / funny / important to this specific group of people? Pay attention and take notes.<br><br>2. Ask questions - Focus on open ended questions, especially HOW &amp; WHY questions. Ask these questions to pull out the story of others and get them to talk more. A great tip to start is to prepare a few interesting questions in advance.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;3. Experiment - So now that you know topics that this specific group likes to discuss, start talking about it! If you’re in a group of people that loves talking about food - bring up that new restaurant across town, or the Jamie Oliver’s recent tweet about meat free meals!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The most important thing at each step is to pay close attention to how people respond (write it down!), reflect and try again :)<br>&nbsp;<br><br>So, if this topic is interesting for you or you simply want to know more, let me know.<br><br>Additionally, if you find this video helpful and like to see more - let me know!<br>Leave a comment, like the video, share with others or write me a poem!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;ok, just kidding about the poem, but I am serous about leaving a comment!<br><br></li></ul></li></ul><div></div>

      <div>ACTIVE Vocabulary <br>Here are my 3 steps, plus one essential piece of advice.</div><div>Advice: Don’t try to learn 100 new words in 1 day or 1 week.</div><div>It just isn’t possible. You’ll get discouraged and give up.</div><div>So here are my 3 steps for a more effective strategy to remember new vocabulary:</div><div>Step 1: Find the words that are important to you, the words you actually use. Your brain will remember the things that are important.&nbsp;</div><div>Step 2: Now that you have a word that’s important to you, your brain wants to find ways to connect it to your real life. Create sentences that are connected to your REAL life. I recommend three. Here’s my example if I want to use more advanced word for ‘hard’ like demanding.</div><ul><li>Learning French was certainly <strong>demanding</strong> for me but it was worth it.</li><li>At the end of a <strong>demanding</strong> work week, I love to have a quiet night at home with my husband, a delicious dinner and a glass of wine.</li><li>I try to do at least 1 or 2 <strong>demanding</strong> workouts every week.</li></ul><div>Step 3: The next step is USE them. Do it as much as possible this week. Repetition will ensure that you remember the new words you want to use.&nbsp;</div>
