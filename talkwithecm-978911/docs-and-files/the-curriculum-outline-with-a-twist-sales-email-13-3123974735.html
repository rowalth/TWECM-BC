      <div><em>Note from Raelyn: This email is especially great for converting buyers who are more logical. However, this email isn’t as simple as just regurgitating the contents included in the modules and expecting your customers to purchase. Instead, you want to take the potential customer on a journey from module 1 (step 1 of their journey) to the last module (they have now achieved the end result). They go on a journey of imagining how their life could possibly change after each module. Be sure to weave in benefits (how their life will change, people care about this at the end of the day) and not just features (good to know, but yawn-inducing and doesn’t really tap on the strong emotions that will drive your subscribers to purchase).</em></div><div><strong><br>Subject Line: Breaking Down [Course Name] Email Copy:<br></strong>Hey [first name]!<br><br></div><div>I have received many questions about [Course Name], and am honored that [#] of you have already joined us!<br><strong>In [Course Name], you get everything you need to [end goal]...<br></strong>Let me show you the step-by-step process you will be following with [Course Name] that will<br>take you from where you are now to achieving [end result(s)]!<br><strong>Here is the module breakdown of what you will learn in [Course Name]:</strong><br>In Module 1, you will [what will they learn in module 1?].
