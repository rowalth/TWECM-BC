This may sound simple but, in the heat of the interview, it’s easy to give an unstructured answer, miss out key details, or let the story fall flat and peter to a halt. If you've had these experiences or if this kind of question makes you feel nervous, this tool kit is for you! Each step in this toolkit is designed to give you the a clear process to help you move from stumbling around for words to a well polished answer. <br><br>Because past performance can be a good predictor of the future, interviewers ask these questions to determine whether candidates have the skills and experiences required to excel in the job. Your answer should describe not only how you approached your previous job duties, responsibilities, challenges and interpersonal relationships in the workplace, but also what you learned from these experiences that shape who you are today.<br><br>In other words, interviewers are not so interested to know about what happened to you, but rather what skills and experience did you gain that you can apply to similar situations in the future. <br><br><strong>TASK: WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE</strong><br>17 questions<br>Let's start with your past experience. Take some time to reflect on your previous experience - what have you already experienced or done that helps shape who you are today?<br><br>Use these 17 questions to help trigger your memory. <br><br>Take some time to review these questions and respond only in key words (don't write out your answer, only write enough to trigger your memory).<br>Not all of the questions apply to you &amp; that's fine, find the ones that do &amp; answer them.<br>Reflect on your past experience and respond with keywords only:<br><br>1. Did you save time and money for the company? How much? What positive effects did these savings have on the company?<br><br>2. Did you publish important reports, research contributions or newspaper articles? Who was the target audience? How big &amp; long was the reach?<br><br>3. Think of examples of effective project or personnel management. What was the result of your efforts?<br><br>4. Have you developed new work systems or processes? How many people did you train or support in using the new system? How much money did these changes provide?<br><br>5. Have you recovered productivity, idling or reduced waste? What were the effects?<br><br>6. Have you ever discovered a problem &amp; then worked to solve it? What was the result?<br><br>7. Have you made connections between individual departments? How have you managed to increase your efficiency?<br><br>8. Has someone in a higher position noted your achievement or complimented you on your contributions?<br><br>9. Have you been able to produce reports or statistics that have better informed operators and thus facilitated decision-making?<br><br>10. Were you responsible for reducing staff or reducing the incidence of work? How did you manage these tasks?<br><br>11. Did you initiate a functioning sales program or another large project? What was the quantitative result? How did it affect the image of the company or the motivation of the employees?<br><br>12. Have you ever introduced a new system or workflow that has made it easier for you or others to work or improve outcomes?<br><br>13. Have you increased the efficiency of employees or work processes? How high are the savings?<br><br>14. Have your efforts increased the size of the company? When?<br><br>15. Do you receive any awards, recognitions or special engagements? If so, why?<br><br>16. Were you involved in decision-making processes or planning? What contribution have you made to this? What were the results of your efforts?<br><br>17. Were you involved in foundations or closures? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?<br><br>Reviewing this list of questions and reflecting on your professional life can bring up a lot of memories, thoughts &amp; feelings. Take a few moments to breathe this in and write down a few words and describe your thoughts and emotions in the box below.<br><br><strong>TASK: SKILLS</strong><br>It's time to get ready for your dream job! Take a look at the specific job or positions that interest you. Select a few sample job postings.&nbsp;<br><br>STEP 1 -<br>Create a list of the preferred qualifications for the ideal candidate for your target job. If a job advertisement is well-written and detailed, you might be able to assemble much of your list right from the job post. Focus on keywords describing skills, qualities or experiences listed. Take a moment to review the job duties and make some assumptions about the qualifications needed to carry out those duties.</div><div><br>Make a list of the skills and/or experiences that are required for the job.<br><br>To help get you started, here is a short list of skills required for higher level positions:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>problem-solving skills</li><li>analytical ability</li><li>creativity</li><li>perseverance through failure</li><li>writing competency</li><li>presentation skills</li><li>teamwork orientation</li><li>persuasive skills</li><li>quantitative skills</li><li>accuracy / precision</li></ul><div><br>STEP 2 -<br>Your next task is to match your qualifications to those listed in the job posting. Then, consider specific examples of occasions when you displayed those skills. <br><br>Take some time to review the list you created on the previous page and respond only in key words (don't write out your answer, only write enough to trigger your memory).<br>You might not have specific stories to demonstrate each quality at this point, that's fine. You can always come back later.<br><br>Reflect on the skills in your list and respond with keywords only:<br><br><strong>TASK: Storyboards<br><br></strong>Now that you have a number of specific example stories fresh in your mind, use My S.E.L.F. Story technique to zero in on key details and develop your story map.<br><br><strong>Skill: </strong>List the specific skill or quality that you wish to highlight.<br><strong>Keywords: </strong>List other skills or qualifications related to this story.<br><strong>Question: </strong>Write an example question.<br><br><strong>S - Situation</strong> - Explain the situation or context. <br>Describe the situation that you were in or the task that you needed to accomplish. You must describe a specific event or situation, not a generalized description of what you have done in the past. Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand. <br><br><strong>E - Experience </strong>- What was your responsibility in the situation?<br>What goal were you working toward? What difficulties or challenges did you face? This is where you get into the nitty gritty of the problem.<br><br><strong>L - Leverage</strong> - How did YOU leverage the situation?<br>Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on YOU. What specific steps did you take and what was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a project, but what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we” when describing actions. <br><br><strong>F - Fresh Perspective </strong>- What did you gain from this experience that you will take with you into the future?<br>Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about taking credit for your behavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Be honest about what happened and don't be afraid to admit failure. The key message here is not so much what happened, but rather what you gained from the experience. <br><br><strong>Example Worksheet:</strong><br><br><strong>Storyboards<br><br></strong>Skill: Works well under pressure<br>Keywords: tight deadline<br><strong><br>Question:</strong> Tell me about a time you had to complete a task within a tight deadline. Describe the situation, and explain how you handled it.<br><br></div><div>S - Situation - ABC company, when Steve quit<br><br>E - Experience - The whole project was passed on to me - with no training!<br><br>L - Leverage - I created a task force and delegated work with clear deadlines<br><br>F - Fresh Perspective - completed the assignment with a day to spare - I believe I thrive when working under tight deadlines.<br><br><strong>Summary Sentence</strong>:&nbsp;<br>While I typically like to plan out my work in stages and complete it piece by piece, I can also achieve high-quality work results under tight deadlines</div><div><strong><br><br>Short Answer: </strong>While I typically like to plan out my work in stages and complete it piece by piece, I can also achieve high-quality work results under tight deadlines. Once, at a former company, an employee left days before the imminent deadline of one of his projects. I was asked to assume responsibility for it, with only a few days to learn about and complete the project. I created a task force and delegated work, and we all completed the assignment with a day to spare. In fact, I believe I thrive when working under tight deadlines.<br><br></div><div><strong>Blank Worksheets<br><br>My S.E.L.F.

They're practically formulaic, and once you get the hang of using the formula, giving good answers to interviewers' questions starts to come naturally. <br><br>My S.E.L.F. Story technique will set you up to provide a clear and complete answer to the interviewer's question, provided you use understandable examples from past work experience.<br><br><br><strong>Check-list:&nbsp; <br></strong><a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DADTBrVK__s/share?role=EDITOR&amp;token=4fNfcVdmihr2vS290wEPhQ&amp;utm_content=DADTBrVK__s&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=sharebutton" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">I made an infographic here.</a></div><ul><li>Do tie your story back to the specific character traits the interviewer is looking for (e.g., dedication or teamwork) // Don't wind your story around to highlight other skills that you think are important.</li><li>Do keep it short - 1 to 3 minutes tops. // Don't tell every detail, only give information that brings your story forward.</li><li>Do highlight measurable results, rather than subjective (Quantify when possible) // Don't lie or give false information.&nbsp;</li><li>Do add a simple statement at the end to reinforce your message (What is your takeaway?) // Don't end your story ambiguously. "So...yeah, that was it, I guess."</li><li>Do <strong>Take Your Time. </strong>It’s okay to take a moment before answering the question. Take a breath, or a sip of water, or simply pause. This will give you time to calm any nerves and think of an anecdote that appropriately answers the question. // Don't feel pressure to keep talking &amp; just fill the air with meaningless words. Be intentional and allow silence from time to time.&nbsp;</li><li>Do <strong>Prepare Ahead of Time. </strong>Review common behavioral interview questions ahead of time and practice your answers. // Don't assume that you'll magically know what to say when asked. A well practiced answer illustrates your level of effort and enthusiasm. Effort and enthusiasm are evidence that you take the process seriously and that you're concerned about making a favorable impression on the interviewer.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>Do practice <strong>my S.E.L.F. Story Technique. </strong>By completing each of the four steps, you will provide a thorough answer without rambling or getting off topic. // Don't try to spontaneously create a new story telling framework. Stick with my S.E.L.F. Story technique because it works! This technique ensures that you stay focused on only the essential elements of the story without forgetting any key details!</li><li>Do stay <strong>Positive. </strong>Often, behavioral interview questions require you to focus on a problem or a failure at work. Describe the problem or issue you faced, but don’t focus too much on the negative. Quickly shift to describing how you solved the problem and achieved positive results. // Don't play the victim. Complaining about past employers or coworkers doesn't not put you in a good light. Follow the S.E.L.F. Story format and keep the focus on YOU.</li></ul><div></div>
