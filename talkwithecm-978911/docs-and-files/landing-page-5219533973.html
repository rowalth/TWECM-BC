      <h1>Do you want to be part of my pilot productivity session and get S**T done?</h1><div>My productivity sessions give you the tools to create an environment that enables peak performance — a mix of social accountability and a lightweight structure to get work done. This event is 100% free.<strong> I am doing this this for free to develop the methodology, connect with like minded people, and get S**T done in the process.</strong><br>You can sign up now to get more details on the schedule of the next sessions and to be part of a great community driven initiative.&nbsp;</div><h1>Sign up to be part of this workshop</h1><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Opt in to receive news and updates.</div><div>Save my spot</div><div><br></div><h1>Some reflections after previous working sessions</h1><div><br></div><ul><li>This setting has been eye-opening and extraordinarily valuable.&nbsp;</li><li>I was pleasantly surprised with my performance — at least 3x more productive than normal.</li><li>This program's format is awesome for productivity.</li><li>Work Junks is a simple concept, but don’t be fooled by the simplicity</li></ul><div>People report anywhere from a 25% to 400% boost in effectiveness from attending these sessions.</div><div><br></div><h1>The Methodology</h1><div>First thing’s first — this isn’t a seminar, this is not an entertainment show. You will listen to a boring "blah, blah, ..." presentation, but rather roll up your sleeves and work. Bring your most important work you want to get done!You will do some brief planning and laying things out in a spreadsheet I have set up for you. At the end of each 30 min. you take a break from your work, assess how the last cycle went, and plan the next one.<strong>Don't be fooled by the simplicity of the method!</strong>This is an incredibly reliable way to reflect on your work progress and see what’s effective and what isn’t and get work done.It works incredibly well.&nbsp;</div><h1>The Community</h1><div>There’s a lot of known science about how people perform better in groups than by themselves, and in supportive groups best of all. You know you’re going to be reporting back your results in 30 minutes.This gives surprisingly huge boosts to productivity. In athletics, sports scientists have seen that people training in groups get as much as 13% higher power output while feeling less fatigued than when working out alone — which, you know, is kind of incredible when you think about it.It’s very cool to be working alongside terrific people doing interesting things. You learn a lot, you get a boost of motivation, you get more done, you feel less tired, you might learn and build some new mental models about how other people organize their work.</div><h1>Why am I doing this?</h1><div><br></div><ol><li>Because I think it’s a game changer,</li><li>Because I think it’s a really powerful thing that the world needs more of,</li><li>And because the type of people likely to come — ie, you — are probably our type of people, and we always want to get to know more of our type of people.&nbsp;</li></ol><div><br></div><h1>This sounds great.
