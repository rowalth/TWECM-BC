      <div>worksheet for 3 secrets to successful networking<br><br>Where to start?<br><br>To boost your networking success, use this toolkit to focus on your networking goals and define what you want to accomplish with your networking efforts. Investing your time now will put you ahead of others and save you hours by clarifying not only which networking events you should attend and where on social media you should be hanging out, but, more importantly, which activities you should put aside for now. You can't do everything, so focusing on your targets now will help you to truly maximise your benefits. <br><br>1. <strong>Look Good - Tactical planning&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div>The whole idea of attending a networking event, on putting yourself out on social media, is to meet new people and extend your professional network. This means you'll be making a lot of first impressions – and we all know how important those can be! When you first meet someone new, there two things that you can control:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>How you look&nbsp;</li><li>What you say</li></ul><div>We will talk about what you say next, but for now prepare yourself for success by dressing the part. It's no secret how important the way you look can be to making a favorable first impression, so be sure to look clean dressed in an appropriate outfit. On digital media, always use a quality professional photo of yourself, people aren't really interested in your dog, baby or last birthday cake. For live events, when you are looking for professional connections, you'd do well to dress the part. Even if the invite says "casual," it is better to err on the side of formal business attire. No one will fault you for looking too good.</div><div><br>What to wear -&nbsp; ____________________________<br>What to bring - (business cards, marketing materials, extra battery charger, etc.)__________________________________________<br><br></div><div>What to say:<br>It may seem scary to be one of the first to arrive, especially if you feel nervous about the event. Yet, the truth is that arriving late means that you could spend a lot of valuable time wandering around trying to catch the crowd. Take my advice and arrive early. This means that you will be there calm and collected networking with other early arrivals before the event gets overwhelmingly crowded. Also, remember, everyone is there to meet people too. So you can help them out by smiling and speaking first. 'Hi, my name is Elizabeth. What brings you here?' Be ready to follow up with your prepared introduction or&nbsp; practiced 30 second pitch. When you are able to start a conversation naturally this skill can not only help you feel more confident, but also helps others feel more comfortable too - what a great start!<br><br>Brainstorm 3-6 opening lines / quick introductions<br>'Hi, my name is Elizabeth. What brings you here?<br>_____________________</div><div><br>2. <strong>Speak Well - Your Speaking Toolkit</strong><br><br>In addition to thinking about the physical items that I may want to bring to a networking event, I also mentally prepare my Speaking Toolkit. Like any toolkit, my speaking toolkit is filled with different topics, techniques and tools prepared and ready for me to use at any given moment. No more stumbling for words, or suffering through awkward silences - Brilliant!<br><br><br>Create your own Speaking Toolkit<br> <br>Answer these two key questions to take control of the flood of input at large events and zero in on results:<br><br><strong>Why are you there? What is your goal?&nbsp;</strong></div><div>Many networking events use promotional materials to help you know who will be sharing information and what you can expect from the event. What they don't publish is the reason why you are there - what is your goal?&nbsp;<br>Is your primary goal getting a job, finding qualified customers or extending your network?&nbsp;<br><br></div><ul><li>Identify your general networking goals with this sentence:<ul><li>I will use my network to .......&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><div><br><br></div><div><strong>Who do you want to meet?&nbsp; </strong><br>Maybe you are in the market for a new job. Or perhaps you just moved to a new city and this wine tasting event looks like a good place to meet some like minded people. When going to a networking or social event, it is pretty easy to see who will be there. Most events publish this kind of information to attract visitors like you. Increase your focus and effectiveness by clarifying these questions before you go.<br><br>Who do you want to meet?_________________________________________________<br>What information do you need from others?_________________________________________________<br><br></div><div>Pack your Speaking Toolkit with these additional power tools:<br><br></div><ul><li>What current events or interesting topics could you bring up? (3-6)_________________________________________________</li><li>Which topics or subject areas do you want to avoid? _________________________________________________</li><li>What value can you offer others?_________________________________________________</li><li>What do you hope to gain before the end of the event?_________________________________________________</li><li>What will make this event a success for you?(be specific)_________________________________________________</li></ul><div><br><br><br><br>3. <strong>End Strong - Guide</strong><br><br>Closing a conversation well, saves you a lot of headaches and worry. There is almost nothing more painful feeling of being stuck with no idea how to end a conversation... Ummm...<br><br>If the contact is a good match for you, ending strong not only shows that you respect the other person's time, but also that you feel confident about future interactions. This leaves your listeners with a positive feeling and good impression of you.&nbsp;<br><br>Sometimes contacts are not such a good match. We've all been there. You may feel trapped by an unrelenting chatterbox who won't even let you put two sentences together. In this case, learning how to end a conversation well can free your path to move on to more successful conversations.&nbsp;<br><br>Take a few moments now to brainstorm a few exit strategies to end a conversation clearly without falling into awkward silences, hiding behind your phone or staring off into the distance. I will even give you two great examples to help you get started.&nbsp;<br><br>Brainstorm a few one-liners (3)</div><ul><li>Thanks so much for your time, I'll send you a follow up email first thing tomorrow!</li><li>Thanks for your time, I have to go to another meeting now.</li></ul><div>__________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br><strong>Follow up, Follow up, Follow up</strong><br>Although it is probably the most important part of going to a networking event, many networkers still don't follow up with new contacts. By not reconnecting outside of the event itself, these people are essentially throwing away pure gold. Don't make this mistake by undoing all the work you put into preparing for and attending the event in the first place. <strong>There is simply no excuse for not reaching out.</strong> Even if you're not looking for a new job or clients, solidifying a contact and building your professional network is always worth your effort.<br><br><br>(chart)<br>Name<br>contact details (company/role, email, linkedIn, phone, address, etc.)<br>Personal style - (Any other notes personal traits or ways they communicate)<br>Passions &amp; Interests</div><div><br>How did we meet?</div><div>Does this person actually know my name/face?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What value have I added?&nbsp;</div><div>Have I asked for something?&nbsp;</div><div>Open topics/things to follow up</div><div><br></div><div>relationship next steps</div><div><br></div><div></div>
