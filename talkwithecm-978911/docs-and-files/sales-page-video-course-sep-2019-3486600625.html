It's not!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The truth that most people don’t talk about is that the real key to success, both professionally and personally, is relationships and your ability to connect with people and build relationships is the single greatest competitive advantage that you can get.&nbsp;<br><br>Think about it - more promotions &amp; hires are from referrals than any other method and most romances (from marriages to a fun evening out) are from introductions by friends.<br><br>So, if you are tired of getting lost in the crowd or being forgettable, you'll be glad to know that the ability to form stronger relationships can be taught.<br><br></div><div>So, what is the QUICKEST and MOST EFFECTIVE path to building relationships?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It’s NOT LinkedIn...</div><div>It’s NOT Social Media…</div><div><br></div><div>It is...&nbsp;</div><div>face to face - Talking to people</div><div>and no matter how advanced digital technology may be, real conversations are not going away any time soon.</div><div><br></div><div>Can you really afford to continue making meaningless small talk that does nothing to grow your network or advance your career?</div><div><br></div><div>Introducing S​tart Your Conversation With Success​ - my proven system to get unstuck, overcome your fears and speak confidently in English to connect with others, accelerate your career and reach your goals.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Hi, My name is Elizabeth, and I am the ecm of talkwithecm. I’ve created a program to show you exactly how to instantly connect with people and make your vision a reality. I'll give you insights on how to make meaningful contacts and build up your power network!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>In this course I’m going to systematically show you how to quickly and dramatically improve your speaking skills regardless of where you currently are on your English speaking journey.</div><div><br></div><div>That means that the next time you’re out at a bar, a party, or business event, you’ll be able to confidently approach new people and always know exactly what to say.</div><div>I'll show you how to use the power of body language and charisma to create lasting connections with people.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you are tired of feeling awkward, forgettable or just sick of missing out, I'll show you how to confidently approach new people and always know the right words to use.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Here's what you'll get in the course:</div><div>- Strategies to help you get over your fears and effortlessly approach people</div><div>- My bullet proof plan to conquer your inner critic</div><div>- Word for word scripts to help you navigate small talk like a pro</div><div>- Proven techniques to engage your audience, build trust and create intimacy&nbsp;</div><div>- and more!<br><br>Each module in this course is broken into 3 sections:<br>+deep dives - to help you dig deep, and gain a deeper understanding of concepts plus some of the psychology behind why we do what we do<br>+language lab - you'll get hands on experience to practice what you are learning<br>+weekly challenge - it is time to get out and use these skills in the real world, to help you flex your speaking muscles and continually boost confidence with your success.</div><div><br></div><div>Sure, it is totally possible to keep doing what you have been doing for your social life and even your work, but you will soon hit limitations. I guess that if you are being honest with yourself, you can already think of a few times in your own life where your ability to connect with people has made the difference between making the contact, or walking away empty handed. I don't want you to walk away empty handed any more.</div><div><br></div><div>Here at talkwithecm we believe that deep inside you already have what it takes to grow your career and build successful relationships. My tools help you unlock your potential to accelerate your career and access the best part of you that is just waiting to come out.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>This course is for you if you are ready for something that actually works.</div><div>Maybe you've already taken English classes, Read articles on the web, tune into podcasts, perhaps you’ve even invested energy into trying to feel more confident but you easily get stuck in your head, overthinking things or feel like you are constantly second guessing yourself.</div><div><br></div><div>Probably in your mind, your English is great and the last thing you want to see is another vocabulary list. But when someone asks you a question, you freeze. It's like your mind goes blank and you lose the words you want to say. You stumble. You feel stuck, frustrated, and sometimes embarrassed. Or worse, you noticed that people's eyes wander away &amp; start gazing around the room, right in the middle of your sentence - like they are not even listening!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I understand. I really do. As a language learner myself, I've been there! I've learned german, chinese, and a bit of russian myself and I know what it's like. I too have struggled to gain confidence in a foreign language. Because I didn't feel confident, I actually watched valuable connections and career opportunities pass me by. But this doesn't have to happen to you. I want to help you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For years, I've helped high level professional people speak English more confidently and clearly with powerful strategies to get unstuck and finally get over the fears that have held them back for years.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now I've combined some of my best material and most powerful tools to create a new course - Start Your Conversation With Success to empower people just like you to expand their opportunities for work, relationships &amp; more.
