That means, taking a position lower than they want, a salary less than they deserve, etc. These decisions often come from a lack of confidence, desperation or peer pressure. “Just take it, get your foot in the door!” But the truth is that these choices are really harmful not only for now, but for the long term as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br><br></div><div>People’s impressions of you and what you are capable of are based on your current position /level of responsibility /salary /etc. Although it may seem unfair, think about it this way, when a position in management opens up, most people don’t look at the list of interns to fill the position. “But there might be a really great person there!” Maybe…but is that where you would look first??</div><div><br><br></div><div>I really like the words that you used "I am more than this!"

      <div>Being honest is always a good idea, especially since you said it yourself "I WANT to be honest." Think of what could happen if you do get the job, they will find out that you are a parent...and well, starting off with a lie just puts everything you say &amp; do into question. Not a great idea for a first impression!&nbsp;</div><div><br><br></div><div>Of course, being honest and playing into stereotypes is not the same thing. Do you want to work part time because you are a mum, or is there more to your story than that? I'm guessing that there is more! As many others have already pointed out there are several ways for you to describe your situation / desires / goals WITHOUT saying, "I'm going to come into work sleep deprived and I'll probably need a lot of time off!" (That's what employers are afraid of, right?)</div><div><br><br></div><div>So, I suggest that you take some time and zero in on the real reasons that you want to work part time - flexibility/ developing side projects/ less responsibility/ other priorities/ whatever it is for you/ and put that forward. I urge you to think ahead, and instead of giving a standard answer "I'm a mum" and leaving the door wide open for them to complete the picture with their own ideas, craft an answer that gives more insight into YOU and your exact situation.&nbsp;</div><div><br><br></div><div>-What value are you bringing to the job?</div><div>-What value are you bringing elsewhere that speaks to your character?</div><div><br><br></div><div>Here's an example:</div><div><br><br></div><div>"I am eager to advance my career and stay on top of new developments within the Pharma industry, while maintaining my other commitments, including my involvement with the XYZ foundation, volunteering and, of course, my family. At this point, a part time position offers the best match."</div><div><br><br></div><div>(See how this answer highlights clear goals, drive and reliability - without being dishonest, shifty or problematic.)</div>
