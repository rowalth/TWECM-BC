      Talking to strangers
      
    </h1>

      <div>Malcolm Gladwell<br>Humans are ill-equipped to understand strangers. We assume that people tell the truth, so we can’t detect lies. And we believe that we can judge strangers based on little, usually deceptive, information. The result of this misplaced confidence is that we don’t invest enough time and patience in truly listening to and understanding each other.<br><br>In a 2001 experiment, psychologist Emily Pronin asked a group of people to quickly fill in the missing letters in words like ‘GL_ _’ or ‘_ _ TER.’ Afterward, Pronin asked them to analyze what their word choices said about them. Most said that their choices were meaningless. Whether they’d written ‘glum’ or ‘glad’ didn’t reflect their personality or even their mood.&nbsp;<br>However, when Pronin showed the group lists completed by other people, everything changed. Clearly, this person was goal-oriented, the group decided, based on the words chosen. Another was obviously tired. While people were confident that their own word choices were random, they easily read into strangers’ word choices.<br>Pronin’s research points to a simple truth. With the smallest glimmer of information, we judge people we don’t know at all. We’re confident in our own complexity, but strangers are easy. Well, if there’s one thing these blinks show us, it’s that they are not.&nbsp;<br><br>The performances in Friends are transparent. Transparency is the idea that someone’s demeanor reveals an authentic picture of their feelings. It’s one of the primary expectations we have when judging strangers. The problem is that transparency is often completely misleading.<br><br>When we look at a stranger’s face, we think we can read it like we can read Ross in Friends. But life isn’t an episode of Friends, and we can completely misinterpret what the stranger is thinking. And, as we’ll see now, that can have serious real-life consequences.<br><br>Psychologist Tim Levine runs an experiment in which subjects watch videos of students interviewed about a trivia test they participated in. Fellow students – actually working with Levine – encourage them to cheat. In the videos, Levine asks the students, “Did you cheat? Are you sure you’re telling the truth? If I ask your partner, will she tell me the same?”<br>Some cheating students lie, some ‘fess up immediately. Others didn’t cheat, so their denials are truthful. The challenge for Levine’s test subjects is to watch the videos and decide who is lying. Levine has run the experiment many times, and the results are worrying. On average, people correctly identify liars just 54 percent of the time. That goes for everyone – therapists, police officers, judges and even CIA officers are terrible at telling who’s lying.<br>The reason for this is simple. Generally, those watching the videos believe that most people are telling the truth. To tip from suspicion to disbelief, observers need an absolutely clear trigger. This could be clear agitation, total avoidance of eye contact or someone struggling to find words when directly accused of cheating. Without that trigger, our suspicions remain just that, and we assume truthfulness.</div>
