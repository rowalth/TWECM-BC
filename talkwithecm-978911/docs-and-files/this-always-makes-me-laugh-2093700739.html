      <div>This morning, while I was walking with Roman down the street - it happened. A near collision with a random stranger. <br><br>We've all been there.<br>You're walking down the street, or hallway, &amp; you notice someone coming your way. You're both walking directly towards each other. You swerve to the left the same time that they do, so you duck right, just as they are redirecting to the right as well - ARG! Suddenly, you're caught in a weird dance, trying to avoid ramming into a total stranger...and the moment of impact is only milliseconds away!<br><br>Then one of you makes a decisive action to go right, collision is avoided &amp; everyone goes on with their life.<br><br>Some people get grumpy about these situations, but I always find it funny. Roman &amp; I even had a bit of a chuckle this morning. Here were two strangers, who never met before, going out of their way to be polite and skirt around each other and avoid total impact, without saying a single word. This so fascinating, because, unlike driving a car, there are generally no laws, rules or even agreed upon patterns about the line of motion when walking. People just non-verbally negotiate and figure it out as they go.<br><br>These situations are a great way to see non-verbal communication &amp; body language at it's best! And the good news is that humans avoid random collisions everyday without saying a word. <br><br>So, what takeaways do I see here:<br><br><strong>1. Non-verbal communication is everywhere &amp; we all do it - without even thinking about it. </strong>This is not something only people with a high education or high salary do - <em>everyone </em>communicates non-verbally. It is not something that we are taught how it do. Imagine sitting in a classroom learning how to avoid hallway collisions - yeah, my school didn't offer a class. It's not a new hip or trendy thing that only young people are into, <em>people of all ages</em> communicate in this way. I nearly had a head-on with a man, well into his retirement, the other day. <br><br><strong>2. Non-verbal communication is a language that we can learn to understand more deeply.</strong> I often watch the people around me, and take notice about how they are standing, sitting, fiddling with their pen, whatever. Start to observe what is happening around you, look for patterns, and invest a few moments each day to develop your understanding of body language. Think about it this way - if everyone around you suddenly started speaking Klingon, you'd be wise to start learning at least the basics. <br><br><strong>3. Non-verbal communication can help us. </strong>With a bit of insight, we can learn how to be congruent with our non-verbal communication and further support the words we are saying. When speaking, I like to do a mental check to make sure that my body language matches what I'm saying and that I'm giving a consistent message.&nbsp;<br><br>This is also true for others, I recently saw a sales video where a woman raved about product, but acted uncomfortable and strange when she talked about the price. This seemingly small inconsistency, instantly made me question if the product was really worth the price she was asking.&nbsp;<br><br>Even when we are not aware of it, we are constantly sending out the message, 'This is where I am, the space I need, and the direction I am going.' And the people around you intuitively see how you carry yourself and what information communicate with your body.&nbsp;<br><br>So it is important to think about what you are saying both verbally and non-verbally!&nbsp;<br><br>I'm developing some new material about how to master non-verbal communication and I'd like to know more about your situation.&nbsp;<br><br>Which of these aspects of mastery would be most attractive to you?&nbsp;<br><br>1 - Learning how to positively fill a room with your presence for presentations, pitches or job interviews. &nbsp;<br>2 - Building trust &amp; strengthening relationships with business partners and friends<br>3 - Negotiations - presenting yourself and your position well to find agreement without giving in<br><br>Send me back an email with just the number of the option that applies to you. Or if there is something else you'd like to tell me about, let me know.<br><br>ecm</div>
