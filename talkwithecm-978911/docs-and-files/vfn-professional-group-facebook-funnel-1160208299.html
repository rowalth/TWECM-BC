      <div>FACEBOOK POST:<br><br>Hello everyone!</div><div>I want to start a new VFN group - a VFN Professionals group. This group will focus on questions around the topic "How can I be seen as a professional and have a family at the same time?"&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We will discuss diverse topics such as:</div><div>- How to answer questions about holes (i.e., parental leave) in your CV.</div><div>- How to look and feel professional with baby food stains on your shirt.</div><div>- Where to find reliable childcare when kindergarten is not available?</div><div>- and more!</div><div><br></div><div>For a first step, I would like to create a subgroup here on facebook where we can join together to ask questions, exchange ideas and grow. Later, I imagine live meet ups or workshops based on topics that are important to us as a group.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As this group is meant to be for VFN members and by VFN members, I would like to hear your ideas. What questions do you have? What would help you succeed?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Are you interested in supporting a VFN Professionals group?<br><br><strong>FUNNEL:<br></strong>(header? VFN Professionals)<br><br>Hello &lt;first name&gt;,<br><br><br>I am glad that you are here!<br><br>Did you know that in 7 days more than 80 people have expressed interest in joining our group? What an amazing response! <br>&nbsp;<br>Who is in this group?<br>Some of us are struggling to keep up with the demands of a career and family life.<br>Some are still on parental leave and are anxious about going back to work.<br>Some want to find new employment in Vienna, but don’t know where to start.<br>Some are looking to network and build social contacts with like-minded people.<br><br>One thing that we all have in common is that we are eager to develop new skills and tackle the tough questions related to being seen as a professional and having a family at the same time.<br><br>Powered by this energy and excitement, I am already in the process of planning our first group meeting. (More details about that soon!) But first, I want to talk to you about some organisational details.<br><br>1. Email is our official form of communication <br>As I can no longer use my personal email account to send you important news and information, I will use my talkwithecm.com account to keep everything clean, tidy and professional. Changing over is a fairly painless process and will take you only a few clicks to complete. Click on the link below and follow the three easy steps.<br><br>2. We have a new facebook group - VFN Professionals!<br>All of our official communication (meet ups, workshops, etc.) will be shared via email and this facebook group can be used as an additional platform for asking questions and sharing information together. <br><br>Watch your inbox for news about updates &amp; meetings.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>Elizabeth C.

VFN Professionals)<br><br>Hello &lt;first name&gt;!<br><br>Welcome to VFN Professionals!<br><br>We are a new and growing group and I am glad that you are here. <br><br>The VFN Professionals is a solutions oriented group focused on questions around the topic "How can I be seen as a professional and have a family at the same time?" <br><br>Our activities are based on our three core values: <br>Connect<br>Reflect<br>Perfect<br><br>Today, I want to talk to you about the first value: Connect.<br><br><strong>This group makes it easy for you to connect with others who understand the challenges you face as both a professional and an international family living in Vienna.&nbsp;<br><br>Often when people face struggles, they feel alone, confused and don't even know where to find support. I've seen even highly skilled professional people feel stuck and frustrated, desperately looking for solutions. I created this group so that people can find information when they want to save their career, bring harmony to their family, resurrect their social life or (yikes!) all three.&nbsp;<br><br>At VFN Professionals we understand what you are going through because many of us have faced the same challenges. By discussing and walking through topics with us, you too can get unstuck and find real solutions. As a group we can share resources and support from experience and insider knowledge. You are not alone, you have found your tribe.<br></strong><br></div><div>In the spirit of connecting, take a moment to think about others you know who could benefit from connecting with our group as well. By inviting others to this group, you can help them connect and find solutions to the challenges and problems they face. As an added bonus, by inviting others you will also enrich your own experience with the group.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Are you excited? We are. Because we believe everyone can benefit from sharing our collective knowledge and experience. Invite friends and colleagues to join you in the group with a message like this:<br><br></div><div><em>I just joined VFN Professionals. This is a solutions oriented group focused on questions around the topic "How can I be seen as a professional and have a family at the same time?" Join me! &lt;link&gt;</em></div><div><br>Thanks for helping us help others. Watch your inbox for news about updates &amp; meetings.<br><br>I look forward to meeting you!<br><br>Elizabeth C.

What an amazing response! <br><br>Today I want to continue talking about the first of our three core values - Connect<br><br>Who is in our group? <br>We are large group of international professionals with families in Vienna.

Did you already join our facebook group? <br><br>Our closed facebook group offers you a unique opportunity to connect with some of the busiest people I know - international professionals who are actively working, parenting and creating the life they want here in Vienna. Getting involved with this online group will help you more easily access our collective knowledge and experience base, as well as make new connections with others.<br><br>Today let's look at the second pillar of our three core values - Reflect. TK - added my story<br><br>Our second value, Reflect, is essential because it gives purpose to our activities. Without reflection, the other pieces can easily become busy work and just another thing to add to a long list of tasks for the week. <br><br>As a group, what challenges do we face?<br>Some are looking for ways to keep up with the demands of a career and family life.<br>Some are still on parental leave and are anxious about going back to work.<br>Some want to find new employment in Vienna, but don’t know where to start.<br>Some are thinking about starting their own business.<br>Some are struggling with the MA35.<br>Some are ready to network and build social contacts with like-minded people.<br><br>Where do you fit in? <br><br>We'd love to know. If you have not already, take a few moments now to reflect and introduce yourself within our facebook group. Let us hear your story. Tell us a little bit about who you are and why you want to connect with VFN Professionals. <br><br>I look forward to learning more about you.<br><br>Elizabeth C.

VFN Professionals)<br><br>Hello &lt;first name&gt;,<br><br>What are the biggest challenges that you face?<br><br>Today I want to continue talking about the second of our three core values - <strong>Reflect </strong>- and encourage you to think about why you joined our group.<br><br><strong>How does this group add value to your life? </strong><br><br>As a member of VFN Professionals, you owe it to yourself to reflect on your life and your reasons for being here. This group is here for your benefit and by building up your own skills you will help raise the level of the group as a whole. Think about what you want to accomplish and what you want from the group. <br><br>Do you want to:<br>- refresh you CV<br>- find a mentor<br>- negotiate better work conditions <br>- build up your online presence<br>- boost your professional networking skills<br>- get time management solutions that really work<br>- make a big change in your professional life <br>- connect with like-minded people<br><br>Take a few moments to reflect on your current situation and answer this question:<br><br><strong>In the next quarter, what are the 2-3 biggest topics that I want to have solved? <br><br></strong>When answering this question, focus on what you want to accomplish in the next 3 months. What are the most important and immediate solutions that you need?&nbsp; These should be short term or pressing goals. We'll call this list your <strong>Quarter List</strong>. <br><br>Often speaking out our goals and sharing them with others is the first step towards finding a solution.<br><br>Share your Quarter List in our facebook group or send it to me by email. These lists are useful for building smaller networks within our group and will help guide our plans for upcoming meetings and workshops.<br><br>IMPORTANT: Don't wait until later to create your Quarter List and don't let this email get lost somewhere down at the bottom of your inbox. If you are honest with yourself, it should only take 2 minutes to know what the biggest topics are for you at the moment.&nbsp; So make a quick list, you can always update it later. <br><br>I can't wait to see your Quarter List!<br><br>Elizabeth C. Miller<br>VFN Professionals <br><br>5. &lt;prefect- revisit your list, what is your progress? prioritise What is still missing - what information do you need to find solutions? post of fb&gt;<br><br>(header? VFN Professionals)<br><br>Hello &lt;first name&gt;,<br><br>How is it going? What is your progress?<br><br>Today I want to talk about our third core value - Perfect. <br>(Note: Here the word <em>perfect</em> is used as a verb meaning — you guessed it! — to make something perfect. Be aware of the pronunciation difference: PER-fect as a adjective; per-FECT as a verb.) <br><br>This core value is about action steps. What are we doing to change our situation and move forward?<br><br>At this point, you have had the opportunity to check out our facebook group, connect with others and reflect on your situation. I even asked to you make a short list of the 2-3 topics that you want<strong> </strong>to focus on for this quarter (3 months). We called this your <strong>Quarter List</strong>.<br><br>Today, I encourage you to make a new step towards reaching your goals. Revisit your Quarter List and answer these questions:<br><br>What is your progress?&nbsp;<br>What is still missing?&nbsp;<br>What information do you need to be able to find solutions?<br>At this point, how do you want to prioritise your list?<br><br>Share your results with us in the facebook group. If you feel stuck, let us know. We are building a community and we are here to support each other. If you are not in the facebook group, please share your answers with me via email.<br><br>See you inside the group,<br><br>Elizabeth C. Miller<br>VFN Professionals&nbsp;<br><br>5. &lt;We all know how difficult it can be to stay focused on task, accountability partner or group&nbsp; (pre-made text to share fb/tw/email/whatsapp)&gt;<br><br>(header?
