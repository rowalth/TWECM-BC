Forget about the future, just this breath. No matter what to circumstances, just be kind. Friend, lover, family member, someone who seems to hate you, some you’ve never met on the street, your own soft animal body. Just be kind, in whatever way appropriate. Everything else will work itself out, and you will begin to sense your own pure heart everywhere. Very simple. Just be kind. Only on this breath. - Scott Morrison&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><br><ul><li>It is hard to choose kindness always. I remember one time when I was stuck in traffic for HOURS and then hand to wait another 45 minutes to let a procession pass…because it was the right thing to do.</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;<ul><li>It was HARD people I tell ya H.A.R.D.</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;<ul><li>I wanted to slash and bite and just be a mean horrible human, but I didn’t. And like Scott says, I began to see my own pure heart everywhere and everything did work itself out.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><br><ul><li>xx</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;<ul><li>We never know how far reaching something we say or do today will affect the lives of others tomorrow. You’ll never regret being treated kindly, especially in times when you need it most. Being on the receiving end of a kind act is also proven to make YOU more compassionate towards others. I remember this one time ….</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;<ul><li>What is the most memorable act of kindness you’ve been the receiver of and how did it change you?</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>Laugh, Cry &amp; be happy</li><li>Pets, Friends, Kids</li><li>What inspires me</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Creating Unignorable Polarity - </strong>show MY moral values</div><ul><li>I Call BS - on trends&nbsp;<ul><li>Just talk</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;<ul><li>Prep a few jokes</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>My Pet Peeves - my industry, social media, networking, trends</li><li>Life Lessons Series - what I’m learning - BRAVE</li><li>I would rather series - lighthearted / fun (chocolate vs. vanilla)</li></ul><div>I hate those ‘which pill would you chose’ posts. Because no matter what answer you give, there is a very strong chance you’ll offend someone. I also don’t understand how ME expressing MY opinion on MY timeline offends people…but that is a post for another time.&nbsp;</div><div>I would not call it a pet peeve but it’s definitely up there with things that make me just want to quit social media all together.&nbsp;</div><div>What are things on social media that it seems like everyone loves but it makes you want to swallow nails?</div><div><br></div><div>So many people who work online say they miss the social side of working in an office. They miss the water cooler gossip, happy hour &amp; just hanging out with other adults.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;MADNESS I SAY!</div><div>I revel in NEVER having to wish anyone a happy birthday with a rictus grin on my face. Or having to glue my behind to the chair in a meeting that runs from now until eternity.<br>&nbsp;OK sometimes I do miss the free coffee…<br>&nbsp;What about you? What’s the one thing you definitely don’t miss about office life?</div><div></div>
