Everyone is looking for quick answers to shift their offline activities online without investing time they don't have to learn everything from scratch and without coming across as salesy or like a complete scam.&nbsp; <br><br>I get it. You may not know this about me, but I struggled A LOT when I first started down the path to shift my offline business online. <br><br>I had no idea how to behave online, and I assumed that my offline skills would not translate. So I set aside everything that I knew, listened to 'expert' advice and started chasing after false targets. <br><br>The online world is FULL of false targets - the benchmarks &amp; other things that people tell you are important, and even the key to their success, but end up being nothing more than an distraction on the path to your dream. Without a clear guide, I invested a lot of time, experimenting, testing, tweaking...and here are a few of my false starts. <br><br><strong>FALSE START #1: Make content - a lot of content</strong><br>At the start I created tons of content, articles, posts, videos, tweets, that people just scrolled on by. I fumbled awkwardly with my words trying to grab attention and convince people to buy. But the only thing I managed to do was create more content that no one cared about.<br><br><strong>FALSE START #2: Create scarcity </strong><br>I threw around phrases like,<strong> Last chance! Buy now! Hurry Hurry!</strong> and it made me want to puke in my purse.<br><br><strong>FALSE START #3: Master social media</strong><br>LinkedIn, Blab, Twitter, Instagram, Twitch, Snapchat...I tried it all and tested different hacks and gimmicks, but no one was impressed. I felt like my efforts were a waste of time and I couldn't even attract a decent troll. <br><br>Nothing gave me the real connections to the people who actually want what I'm offering. <br><br><strong>FALSE START #4: Gimmicks, Contests - Prizes</strong><br>Once I even I bought prizes thinking that a giveaway would be THE way to explode my contact list, and it was fun, until it didn't work - AT ALL. I got two email addresses - TWO. I felt totally stupid awarding 1st &amp; 2nd prize with confetti, and third prize was never claimed. <br><br>It was so frustrating. I knew something was missing, but I couldn't figure out what it was.<br><br>I could see others succeeding. I saw other businesses making big money with cheap looking websites and products that didn't offer half the value of what I was giving away for free. What secret sauce were they using? What did they know that I didn't?<br><br>A few times I came very close to giving up - because the idea of me having a thriving online business seemed as realistic as a cat opening a scuba school. <br><a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTYDtFaYQdmT37gCsZqQDcsU_qUmacxj1tkhmjArVzTOF7aexKf&amp;usqp=CAU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTYDtFaYQdmT37gCsZqQDcsU_qUmacxj1tkhmjArVzTOF7aexKf&amp;usqp=CAU</a><br><br>Would <em>you</em> pay this cat to teach you to dive?<br><br><strong>The good news</strong> is that I <strong>didn't </strong>give up.&nbsp;<br><br>After studying, testing, and improving for years, I identified a few simple beliefs holding me back… and some key insights that completely shifted my focus and changed how I approach people and start conversations online, people I already know and people I've just met.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The point is, I slowly and painfully crawled out of it — and now I'm continually expanding and growing my online business - yes, even during the pandemic! Offers, email addresses, clients, income? yes - all of it! <br><br><strong>The bad news</strong> is that there is no funnel, no strategy, no sales video, no ad campaign, no hack or gimmick - nothing is going to replace personal connect - the key deciding factor that makes a person ultimately say yes or no. I am talking about the human element - conversations and personal relationships. <br><br><strong>Making personal connection and building relationships is the greatest competitive advantage you can get. </strong><br><br>Whether it is reading a personal story, getting a referral from a friend, public reviews, testimonials or even talking to a sales rep, most people won't even <strong>think </strong>about getting out their wallet without some form of personal contact. <br><br>So everything that I thought was no longer relevant &amp; was about to flush down the toilet, suddenly became my main focus. Personal connections and meaningful conversations. <br><br>Think about that - putting yourself forward and creating meaningful contact points are a vital part of doing business online, and the current pandemic only amplifies that even more! <br><br><strong>The KEY deciding factor that makes a person ultimately say YES. I need this, or NO and brushing it aside to be forgotten about forever - is personal connection. <br></strong><br>Right now many people feel stuck, frustrated and are sick of feeling overlooked. People crave connection now more than ever before. <br><br><br><strong>So, if you are looking to stand out from the crowd, create trust and let people see your true value - it is time to take a serious look at how you are building relationships online. <br><br><br>Relationships are the key to success. <br><br><br></strong><br>So, what is your <strong>core message</strong>? How are you approaching people?<br><br>This is your foundation and will determine what your path to success will look like. Is it going to be a long track up to the peak of a mountain, an uphill battle in the snow, sleet and rain? Or will it be more like a walk down to the beach, listening to your favorite tunes along the way?<br><br>Sometimes it really is as simple as that. Are people responding to your message with likes, comments, shares, screaming "YES - I need this!" and throwing their wallets at you? Or are you staring at an empty bank account and wondering why people just aren't responding?&nbsp;<br><br>If you are offering something people don't need....it's hard! You'll spend way to much time trying to convince people, begging people to just try your product. No one wants to do that.&nbsp;<br><br>But if you are offering something of real value and can help people solve a problem, get rid of a pain, eliminate a nagging frustration once and for all - your path to success will look more like this: beach<br><br></div><div><strong>Act now and gain in 4 weeks what took me over 15 years, 3 continents, trial and a lot of errors to learn. Don't miss another opportunity and watch someone scroll on by.<br><br>Yes, you CAN :<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Connect with new people online&nbsp;</li><li>Build relationships that matter</li><li>Become an authority in your field&nbsp;</li><li>and increase your sales without being a cyber stalker or scammy<br><br></li></ul><div>I want to show you how STOP doing things that you hate - like screaming "Buy NOW - Hurry! Hurry!" and completely KILL the frustration that comes from begging people to buy.<strong><br></strong><br></div><div><br><strong>This proven system is packed with everything you need to get unstuck, speak confidently in English and connect with the exact people who want the value you offer - on or offline!<br><br></strong>Imagine how it will feel, say next winter, or whenever the next wave of this corna-CRAZY hits, and the economy takes a hit, or businesses must close their doors again, people start to panic...and you are sitting comfortably somewhere on a large plush sofa, happily taking calls from others in your filed because you have already set the ground work to establish yourself as the go-to authority in your field. Maybe you are setting up projects, new deals, chatting with your new connections and making plans for the future. Or perhaps you're just taking the afternoon off - because you can - without even thinking about the financial impact! There you are, the glow of sunshine on your face, sipping on your favorite drink, and dreaming about what you'd like to try next because now that your finances are secure, and your career is finally going in the direction you want, you really have the freedom to decide how you want to spend you time. <br><br>Sound too good to be true? It's not!<br>I'm offering a complete 9 step system so you can go from feeling stuck to being outstanding and actually change the way that others see and respond to you. <br><br>This is not some kind of crazy woo-woo magic. These are proven skills and tactics, backed by science, experience and 100s of case studies. If they can work for me - an expat mom under quarantine, they will work for you!<br><strong><br>If you are serious about meeting the needs of your target audience right now and adding real value to their lives, now is NOT the time to focus on<br></strong>- the tons of content you can create and have sitting unnoticed in a blog somewhere (no one has time for that right now)<br>- making lame claims of false scarcity (there is enough drama going on, don't add stress please!)<br>- become a social media star (sure, that's fun, but there are people who are desperate RIGHT NOW for the exact solution that you can offer, focus on them and worry about clicks/likes/shares later)<br>- cheap gimmicks, giveaways, competitions (If it seems gaudy or scammy - don't do it! This kind of marketing often damages your reputation more than it helps, especially during times of struggle.)<br>- long term planning strategy to...well, do anything! (Times are a-changing, keep your goals clear and your plan agile!)<br>- partnerships / collaborations (physical distancing, remember?)<br><br>Keep your focus clear and adapt your plan according to the people who what what you are offering and are willing to pay for it - not what the hottest new app is offering.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Your ability to connect with people both on and offline is a key factor for securing your future.</strong></div><div><br><br></div><h1><br></h1><div><br>Wondering how this course different from the billions of other solutions out there? <br>Here's how:<br>Others provide one solution - <br>English skills <br>OR <br>communication skills <br>OR<br>presentation skills<br>OR<br>sales techniques<br><br><br>Start Your Conversation With Success<br>English skills +communication skills +presentation skills + sales techniques + PLUS<br>a complete 9 step solution to systematically go from A to B without having to apply tactics and hacks randomly + Proven strategies to build trust and create intimacy with anyone both on <em>and </em>offline +&nbsp; architecture of story telling, persuasion switches, deep psychology about why people behave the way they do + accountability program to guarantee you get results!<br><br>Testimonials:<br><br><br><br>Guarantee:<br><br><br><br></div><div></div>
