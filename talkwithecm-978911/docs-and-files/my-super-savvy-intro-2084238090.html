      <div>Happy New Year!&nbsp;<br>Many of you are my family, friends, and acquaintances. However, I am not sure that I actually know everyone here, and even if I've met you it doesn't mean that we know each other all that well ... or at all!</div><div>So, as a snappy intro for those of you who are like “WHO the - WHAT the - HOW the heck is this crazy person on my feed?" here are some fun insights about me:<br><br></div><div>I am part of that growing group of Professionals with Kids - a concept that I know my grandmother would be proud of! I am unashamedly from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and I will bring it up on the regular, because while it is possible for me to leave Philadelphia, I'll never stop talking about it or calling it home. My current home away from home - and pandemic shelter - is Vienna, Austria.<br><br></div><div>If you've ever seen me out at night or on a dance floor, I am usually bouncing around like a self-driven energy factory - fancy that!&nbsp;<br><br>Some say I look like a librarian or a teacher ... especially when I wear glasses. Others have said I look like Jennifer Grey - you remember Baby from Dirty Dancing, or I have even heard that I look like Sarah Jessica Parker, but that was some time ago. Since the pandemic, I haven't really seen anyone, expect myself in the mirror...Physical distancing is tricky that way.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>All that said, I'm neither a librarian nor an actress. Actually, I am a communication nerd who empowers people to overcome their fears of speaking out in English and master the art of meaningful conversation. I've been told that I am like a ninja with a gift for cracking the code of feeling "not-enough," the myth of "hard-work-pays-off," and for giving others the power to kick imposter syndrome to the curb, so that they can finally start claiming opportunities for work, networking &amp; more!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>I have also been told that I'm more fun to watch than a firework!</div><div>I like to think I am a little bit of all that mixed together (aren’t we all?)</div><div>I like to live in a world where kindness reigns and people get along, even when they don't agree.</div><div>WARNING: Hanging around with me can cause some serious side effects like <em>YES-I-can-do-this-itis</em> and <em>BOOM! I-Got-It-Done Syndrome</em>.<br><br></div><div>A major reason why I'm posting this is because I'd love to get to know you better.&nbsp; :) Leave a comment with an interesting fact about how we met or something interesting about your world that I might not know.</div>

      <div>Who am I copy:</div><div>I wouldn’t say I am an expert in Business Success but the 1,000+ women I have helped to go from frustrated by the lack of commitment from their subordinates to acing their departmental goals through better relationships, would no doubt disagree.</div><div>It’s just one of the benefits of helping so many people beat their frustration with difficult subordinates after they have spent countless hours, days, weeks and even in some occasions, months looking for a solution.</div><div>But this wasn’t always me. Before I threw myself into the world of Business Success I was director at a global conglomerate and it took a tonne of blood, sweat and tears (some of them were even mine, JK) to get to where I am today.</div><div>So, that is why they call me expert...and I’m incredibly proud of it, and of them.<br><br>Why the heck should you listen to me? And who the hell am I anyway?</div><div><br></div><div>Hi, my name is Linda Lederman and I am the Director of Deliciousness at Balaboosta’s Secret: Keys to living a luscious life.</div><div><br></div><div>And, as for why you should listen to me over the countless other voices in the art of meal planning let me give you the short answer (because we are all busy)</div><div><br></div><div>I have Organizational skills up the wazoo from my background as a lawyer. Cooking skills- smack dab confident and creative- owner of over 1000 cookbooks, a graduate of Rouxbe Cooking School and Institute of Integrative Nutrition, countless cooking courses from the International Culinary Center and Natural Gourmet Institute and other sundry cooking meccas under my belt.</div><div><br></div><div>I have worked with Hundreds of busy moms and helped them go from overwhelmed and stressed by their dinner time demons to being cool, calm and confident women who know the answer to "What's for dinner mom" without dread, tears or resorting to cursing.</div><div>And they can a create a week to a month worth of meal planning in less than 30 minutes a week.</div><div>The reason I do it is because I love it. I love being able to help moms struggling with their kitchen confidence. I love knowing that they can forever say buhbye to their dinner time overwhelm. From not being able to plan week night meals to knowing what dinners can be made with speed, ease and maximum yum. It’s love made edible. Seriously. FOR EVER.</div><div><br>And who am I, you ask?</div><div><br></div><div>I’m Anna Prims, and I wouldn’t say I am an expert in online marketing for therapists, but the several frustrated therapists I have helped go from struggling to find enough clients to having a stable and reliable flow of clients (and income!), would no doubt disagree.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s just one of the benefits of helping so many people beat the struggle of finding enough clients to make a (good) living after they have spent countless hours, days, weeks, months and even in some cases years looking for a solution.</div><div><br></div><div>But this wasn’t always me. Before I threw myself into the world of online marketing for therapists I was an English teacher in Japan and it took a tonne of blood, sweat and tears (some of them were even mine, jk) to get to where I am today.</div><div><br></div><div>So, that is why they call me expert...and I’m incredibly proud of it, and of them.<br><br>Who am I?</div><div>I wouldn’t say I am an expert in teaching language, but the scores of adult students in 5 different countries I've helped go from struggling to secure in English would no doubt disagree.</div><div>It’s just one of the benefits of helping so many people get unstuck after they have spent countless hours, days, and sometimes years looking for a solution.</div><div>But this wasn’t always me. Long before I threw myself into the world of teaching English I was a failing language student, who thought I would never be able to learn a foreign language, until I developed my own system to conquer my own language blocks and get to where I am today.</div><div>So, that's why they call me "expert"... and I’m incredibly proud of it, and of them.<br><br>Why the heck should you listen to me? And who the hell am I anyway?</div><div><br></div><div>Hi, my name is Elizabeth and I am the ecm of talkwithecm. I am the fun brain tickler, challenge maker and joy behind much of what we offer at talkwithecm.</div><div><br></div><div>And, as for why you should listen to me over the countless other voices in the world of business and shameless self-promotion let me give you the short answer (because we are all busy)</div><div><br></div><div>I am a conversation advocate - and master of meaningful small talk. I have international communication and business skills up the wazoo from my background in sales, procurement and new business development. Language skills - English, Mandarin, German - (Shhh don't tell Marie Kondo, but I'm the owner of over a 1000 grammar and language books), a graduate of Feng Jia University - yup, an MBA in Chinese! and countless language schools, international negotiation and mediation courses, including hands on practical experience with peace negotiations in N. Ireland, Israel and a few big hairy mergers in the USA. I know the power of authentic connections and relationship building, especially in business. I've further broadened my horizons with community leadership positions, acting, and made some serious cash as a voice recording specialist. Not only am I totally willing to completely suck at something new, but I know the secret code to make impossible dreams - POSSIBLE!<br><br>With all of that experience, the one thing that I noticed again and again is that success, especially in business is directly linked to your ability to connect with others and build relationships, and the whole purpose of Branding, and even personal branding, is to connect with others, start conversations and build relationships.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I have worked with thousands of busy professionals and helped them go from feeling intimidated and over looked to being THE sought after expert in their field, who knew exactly what to say and how to say it without stumbling for words, lame scripts or fake smiles. And they rave about the fact that they can now confidently walk into any room, and effortlessly strike up a conversation - even with complete strangers -and easily talk about themselves / their business / their product with clarity and spark the genuine interest of others.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The reason I do this work is because I absolutely love it. I love being able to help busy professionals find the right words with the right tone to present themselves with ease and power. I love knowing that they can use their voice, and their own words to establish themselves and completely overcome imposter syndrome. From not being able to explain what they do without watching people's eyes gloss over to knowing exactly when and how to engage and intrigue others with magnetic attraction. It’s like having people fall in love with your most honest YOUNESS. Seriously. FOR EVER.</div><div><br></div><div></div>
