That’s a big no-no. You <em>can</em> turn an informational interview into a potential job opportunity, but only if you approach it wisely. Here’s the first step of that process: The email introduction for an informational interview.<br><br>By the way, the best place to get informational interviews is via your alumni association. People who went to the same college have a bond with each other, even decades later.<br><br></li><li><br></li><li><strong>They reached out through a warm contact.</strong> If they didn’t have one, they spent the time to find one by studying who I know. (The info is out there, you lazy asses. Facebook, Twitter, 8 million pages I’ve written, the “Acknowledgements” page of my book. And this isn’t just about me, it’s about any busy person you want to meet.)</li><li><strong>They explained any similarities we had.</strong> An alum reaches out to me who seems genuine? I’ll almost always take a phone call or, if convenient, a coffee meeting. Maybe they grew up in my hometown, or went to my high school. Even I have a small semblance of emotion, leading me to occasionally act like a normal human being.</li><li><strong>They reached out with a BRIEF, CONCISE EMAIL.</strong> I will show you the exact words to use in my Dream Job course so you don’t instantly eliminate yourself.</li><li><strong>They met with me and asked very insightful questions.</strong> GOOD: I noticed you did XYZ. It’s interesting because Very-Important-Person took a different approach and did ABC. What was your thinking? BAD: I’m so unhappy at my job. What should I do with my life? Ugh. Get a bowl of soup and a therapist. That’s not the kind of question you ask at an informational interview.</li><li><strong>They asked questions for 90% of the informational interview,</strong> interjecting insightful comments once in a while, showing that they’d done their homework. In the last 10%, they mentioned what they were working on and asked for advice. When they were especially impressive/likeable, I offered to introduce them to people I know, or outright offered to hire them.</li><li><strong>They never outright asked for a job,</strong> which you never, ever do in an informational interview. They also gave me an “out” in case I couldn’t/didn’t want to help them.</li><li><strong>NOTE: These were not all the most socially smooth people.</strong> Some of them were downright socially awkward. Doesn’t matter! Sometimes, awkward can be endearing! Not everyone is Rico Suave. But the very best showed a remarkable level of preparation, which anyone can do — but few actually do.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>What if you lost your job today and needed <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/ramits-definitive-guide-to-building-your-network-with-scripts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a new job in a week</a>? Could you do it?<br><br></div><div>What if you just wanted some advice for <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-handle-a-career-crossroads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a tough career decision</a>? Is there someone you could ask?&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Or what if you wanted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yyURgdIhRY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">make a big career change</a>, like switching industries? Is there anyone you could call for help?&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The secret to solving all of these challenges is the same: informational interviews. Today, I’ll show you how to conduct excellent info interviews, including the exact questions you’ll want to ask.<br><br></div><div>At a high-level, here’s how an informational interview works:<br><br></div><ol><li>You find someone doing the job you’re interested in</li><li>Invite them out to coffee or ask them to chat over the phone</li><li>Ask key questions about the job and gather insider information</li><li>Then, use what you learned to make an informed decision about your career</li></ol><div>It sounds so simple, but it can have a profound effect on how you get a job. Rather than guessing and checking, this is how you guarantee a job is right for you — before committing to do it for the rest of your life.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Info interviews are even more powerful if you’re proactive:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Most people just keep wishing for a different job. Or worse, they just aimlessly apply to new jobs and take the first offer they get…even if it’s down the wrong career path. With informational interviews, you can <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/video-what-the-pros-know-about-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">build a network of professional friends</a> BEFORE you need them, so when you need advice or a new job, you already have people you can turn to for help.<br><br></div><div>Let me show you how to master this powerful job search tool.<br><br></div><div><br>How to set up and virtually guarantee an interview’s success<br><br></div><div>Most people cringe at the word “interview.” It conjures up images of being put on the spot and asked tough questions.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>While that is how a lot of job interviews go, that’s not how informational interviews work.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In fact, with informational interviews, you barely have to say a word. That’s one of the reasons why I love them so much. There’s no pressure to talk a lot or have all the answers, and they’re tough to screw up.<br><br></div><div>All you have to do is reach out to the person you want to meet with a concise email. (Here are <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/video-how-to-use-natural-networking-to-connect-with-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">word-for-word email scripts</a> you can use to set up a meeting.)<br><br></div><div>During the interview, there are a couple of key pointers to make the meeting a success:<br><br></div><div>1. ASK INSIGHTFUL QUESTIONS — Don’t waste someone’s time with questions you could easily answer with Google. It’s disrespectful and hurts your chances of making a connection with the person.<br><br></div><div>For example:<br><br></div><div>Good question: “I noticed you did XYZ. It’s interesting because [INSERT NAME OF VIP] took a different approach and did ABC. What was your thinking behind that decision?”&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Bad question: “I’m so unhappy at my job. I think I’d like to do what you’re doing. What does someone in your position do again?”<br><br></div><div>In this video, I put together a few more examples of insightful questions to keep the conversation going:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFrTQcIZMGE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Watch: How to Talk to People More Successful Than You<br></strong></a><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div>2. SPEND 90% OF THE INTERVIEW LISTENING — Yes, most of the time, they’ll be talking — NOT you. Only interject with insightful comments every once in a while to show that you’ve done your homework.<br><br></div><div>Remember, you’re learning from them, and the best way to do that is to LISTEN. As for the other 10% of the time, you should spend that telling them what you’re working on and asking for specific advice. This approach is often so effective that the person you’re meeting with will introduce you to even more people.<br><br></div><div>Alright, now that you’ve set up the interview, you’ve done your research, and you have your amazing questions to ask — you’re almost there.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Don’t blow the whole thing by making one of these mistakes.<br><br></div><div><br>Avoid these four interview mistakes&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Imagine you’re the CEO of a local tech company. Your schedule is packed. Tons of people are vying for your attention every day.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Suddenly, some random stranger emails you asking to meet for coffee. Their email is really good (using the above script). You can tell the person has done their research. And since they seem sincere and interested, you decide to take a chance and say “yes” to their invite.<br><br></div><div>You block off 30 min of your already crammed schedule to meet them.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>When you get together, you exchange pleasantries…then the chat quickly derails. The person you’re meeting with starts rambling, talking all about himself, and not asking you insightful questions. You sit there watching the clock thinking, “what a waste of time.”<br><br></div><div>Believe it or not this happens a lot.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>People spend so much time trying to get the informational interview, then blow it when they meet the person in real life.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Here’s a DO and DON’T guide for the four most common informational interview mistakes to avoid.<br><br></div><div>1. ASKING QUESTIONS THAT DON’T MATTER<br><br></div><div>Don’t: Ask them for something that you probably could read on their company blog. It’s like asking me for financial advice. I already answered those questions. Just go read my <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/guides/ultimate-guide-to-personal-finance/part-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">site</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-To-Rich/dp/0761147489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">book</a>.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Do: Ask questions that are open-ended and get the person talking. For example, if they are the CEO of a startup, ask them what they’ve learned from previous start-ups that are making a difference in the success of their current start-up. Make your time with them count.<br><br></div><div>2. RAMBLING AND GETTING SIDETRACKED<br><br></div><div>Don’t: Bore them with insignificant details like what type of food your cat likes or where you go for sushi.<br><br></div><div>Do: Keep things short and to the point. The people you’re interviewing are busy and are doing you a favor. Be courteous and stay on point. Know how much time they have to give and honor that.<br><br></div><div>3. LET YOUR EGO GET IN THE WAY&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Don’t: Don’t talk about yourself too much (remember the 90/10 rule?). The point of the interview isn’t to prove your brilliance; it’s to learn from them.<br><br></div><div>Do: Ask them about their interests, their history, their plans. Make it ALL about them.<br><br></div><div>4. NEVER FOLLOW UP<br><br></div><div>Don’t: Suck them for helpful information and then disappear. This is rude and will make them not want to help you in the future.<br><br></div><div>Do: Send a written thank you note to express your gratitude. Then use my <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/ramits-definitive-guide-to-building-your-network-with-scripts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Closing the Loop Technique</a> to follow up with them on how you’re using what you learned from them. Showing that you’re taking action on their advice is the best “Thank you!” you can give.<br><br></div><div><br>Finally, build your confidence&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Following these informational interview tips will help you stand out from everyone else. But there’s just one piece left for a successful informational interview: confidence.<br><br></div><div>It’s tough to be confident when you’re meeting someone you don’t know, especially a VIP who knows much more about a subject than you — and when there’s so much on the line.<br><br></div><div>I have a simple technique to help you build unshakable confidence in yourself. This free video will help you walk into any meeting or interview confident that things will go exactly as you planned.<br><br><br>We started this year by demolishing several invisible scripts:<br><br></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/why-wont-anyone-be-honest-with-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">‘If he really liked me, he would call me!’</a> (First, look inside: Why do you deserve that top-tier guy or girl? Remember Lyfe Jennings: “Don’t be a nickel out here lookin’ for a dime.”)</li><li><a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/instant-irresistibility-the-7-keys-to-advanced-social-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">‘I’ll never be as smooth as that guy…he’s a natural’</a> (Actually, few people are truly naturals. You become socially skilled with practice — the right kind of practice.)</li><li><a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/2013-the-year-of-taking-control/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">‘I can’t get a Dream Job…I didn’t go to XYZ University / I don’t have 10 years of experience’</a> (Experience matters, but there other factors that matter as much or more)</li></ul><div>Today, we’re going to explore one of those factors that can actually matter MORE than how much experience you have.<br><br></div><div>That factor is your personal network.<br><br></div><div>Ordinary people shrug and treat their network as just another word, something that “other people” have but they do not. Witness any nerdy guy talking about jocks to see the kind of “I don’t have that” barriers I’m talking about:<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>Curious people say, “Hey, I keep hearing about a personal network. Is it possible I actually have one but I don’t know it? How would somebody like me connect with VIPs? Is it even possible? Ok, let me read on.”</div><div><br></div><div>Top performers know that if they lost their job on Friday, they could make a few phone calls and send a few emails — usually, fewer than 10 — and have a job offer by Monday. Compare this to the horror stories you see written up in newspapers about people unemployed for months or YEARS.<br><br></div><div>Top performers can have another job in days (not a typo). In fact, using their networks, top performers actually hear about unadvertised jobs that ordinary people do not.<br><br></div><div>I know because I’ve been on both sides of the table. And today, I want to pull back the veil to show you how natural networking actually works — ethically, and at the highest levels.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>The world’s best networkers<br></strong><br></div><div>If you’re wondering who are the world’s best networkers, let me refer to you a recent trip I took to India. I was there for a wedding, a huge 7-day affair with jewels, horses,&nbsp; and 1,500+ people.<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bride-300x182.png" width="300" height="182"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><em>This is the bride’s mehndi, a decorative ceremony for women during the wedding week.</em></div><div>Those events happen at night. But during the day, things are calm as people recover from the 4am party nights. (No joke, I saw grandmas up at 3:30am parties.) So when I walked into the living room where I was staying, I saw one of my cousins holding up x-rays to the window.<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/x-ray-224x300.png" width="224" height="300"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">
  <img src="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/x-ray-224x300.png" width="224" height="300">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div>“What the hell?” I asked. “How did your hospital send x-rays here?” He’s an orthopedic surgeon at a hospital in Beverly Hills.<br><br></div><div>He looked at me and laughed. “No, these aren’t from my hospital. An aunty down the street heard I was a doctor and asked me to look at her x-rays.”<br><br></div><div>HAHA. Classic Indian move. Some random neighbor heard we had a doctor in the house and sent over her x-rays. I bet you they had nothing to do with orthopedics, but like a dutiful Indian son, my cousin took a look at them.<br><br></div><div>This is an extreme example of your network being larger than you imagine. You may not have the audacity of an Indian, but the fact remains: <strong>We ALL have a network.<br></strong><br></div><div>Yes, even if…<br><br></div><ul><li>You didn’t go to some fancy college</li><li>You live in Podunkville, KS</li><li>You don’t have years of experience</li></ul><div>You have an invisible network that you’re probably ignoring. What if you could unearth it and use it strategically, feeding it and watching it grow? What if your network could help you leapfrog other people who were going through life following the same, tired 9-5 rules?<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Case study: How your network can help you<br></strong><br></div><div>Let me show you specifically how this works.<br><br></div><div>One year in college, I was looking for summer internships. After meeting a few people and being uninspired by the jobs out there, I decided to call one of my friends, who worked at a startup, and get her advice. I said, “Hey, I’m looking for summer internships. What companies do you know about?” I still remember that it was a Friday afternoon, because she told me to send my resume to her, which I did as soon as I got home.<br><br></div><div>By Monday, I had a job offer.<br><br></div><div>And here’s the most ridiculous part. I was told to negotiate my offer…WITH MY FRIEND FROM 7TH GRADE.<br><br></div><div>How did this happen? Yes, I spent the weekend doing lots of research on the company. And yes, when I walked in to interview on Monday, I used my Briefcase Technique to absolutely crush in the interview.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>But what REALLY matters is that my friend recommended me and put her reputation on the line to get me hired. Since she was so valued at the company, her recommendation carried a lot of weight. There was no job listing on the website or Monster.com. They created it for me, and the compensation was essentially “whatever.”<br><br></div><div>By the way, what did she get out of it?<br><br></div><div>Ask yourself this: If I was a loser with no skills who wouldn’t show up on time and did sub-standard work, would she have referred me?<br><br></div><div>OF COURSE NOT! Instead, she knew I would do an awesome job…so when she referred me, she actually got social value from introducing me and fighting for me to get the job.<br><br></div><div>Read that last line, as it’s critical. <strong>If you are a top performer, VIPs WANT you to succeed, and will actually send you job opportunities and recommendations…because it’s in THEIR interest to do so.<br></strong><br></div><div>This flies in the face of what most people think (“Why would a VIP want to help ME?? Waa…). Your network can be incredibly powerful. In this case, I never would have received this opportunity — let alone the compensation I did — if I had gone through traditional channels, like the typical resume Black Hole of Doom like everyone else.<br><br></div><div>The takeaway: Our networks can actually be MORE important than the years of experience we have.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>“Waa! But Ramit…”<br></strong><br></div><div>Right now, many of us are thinking, “Well that’s great Ramit, you jackass, but I don’t have friends who can make a call and get me a job. I didn’t go to the same college. I don’t live in NYC or the Bay Area. I don’t have the same eyebrows you do.”<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/youtube.png" width="418" height="452"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div>These invisible scripts and reactions are normal. Of course we feel betrayed and skeptical when someone tells us we’ve been sitting on a potential goldmine and we haven’t done anything with it. Can it really be that easy? Why wouldn’t everyone do that?<br><br></div><div>I want to be crystal clear about two things.<br><br></div><div><strong>1. Building a powerful network is not easy.</strong> If you want something easy, go find some stupid blog that posts Top 10 Career Tips for Success!<br><br></div><div>My students work harder than ordinary people, but they also get massively disproportionate rewards. For example, if the average person spends 1 hour a week sending their resumes out, my students will spend 3…but they’ll get 10x the response rate. That’s what I call disproportionate results.<br><br></div><div><strong>2. Building a network is not about sending a fake email to someone, pretending to be interested in them, then asking for a job</strong>. If that is your goal, leave. Building real relationships is about investing in them first, figuring out what they want and love, and then helping them get it — NOT instantly expecting a magical job offer. In fact, most of the “networking” you do will simply be helping people and getting nothing back in return. If this makes you uncomfortable and you want a 1-for-1 ROI on your work, leave.<br><br></div><div>When you change your mentality about networking, understanding that it’s about adding value instead of extracting it, you will see massive changes in your life. I won’t just tell you this — I’ll show you.<br><br></div><div>I recently asked my students what they’ve learned about their network — and the results they’ve gotten from using my material on natural networking.<br><br></div><div><strong>“He replied in less than 3 minutes”</strong><br>Hey Ramit, I’ve been using your networking scripts ever since you posted them on your blog a few weeks ago.&nbsp; After 4 rejections and many non-replies (at other companies), I have scheduled an <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/informational-interview-questions-that-create-a-lasting-impression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">informational interview</a>with a finance manager at [MASSIVE SOFTWARE COMPANY].&nbsp; I used my alumni connections through my university to reach him – I wrote an email using the basic elements of your scripts and he literally replied in less than 3 minutes! -Anand P.<br><br></div><div><strong>“I have learned years worth of material in a few hours using the…scripts”</strong><br>The Natural Networking module is worth the cost of the entire Dream Job course by itself. I have learned years worth of material in a few hours just by using the Natural Networking scripts to talk to experts in my industry. I have emailed 10 experts and have talked to 9. Each person gave me great advice to step career to a new level. -Gopi M.<br><br></div><div><strong>“…Completely natural and honest”</strong><br>Ramit, I used your networking email script and it worked! The first email got me an informational interview with the president of a powerful local marketing agency. I also scored an informational interview with a high-level executive from a popular TV and print media empire. All of it felt completely natural and honest.&nbsp; People seem relieved that I am up front, have no angles, and understand that they are busy.&nbsp; And they seem to enjoy being useful, so we all benefit! – Andrea P.<br><br></div><div><em>(Note: All the scripts they’re referring to are in my Dream Job course, which opens in late January to people on my </em><a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>free email list</em></a><em>.

You’re&nbsp; not scamming people (a common invisible script when it comes to networking). What you ARE doing is adding value first…even if you don’t have money or valuable connections. In fact, later I cover exactly how a no-name 20-something can add specific value to a VIP.)<br><br></div><div>But for now, I’m going to give you one of the crucial ways you can continue adding value that <em>almost nobody does</em>. For the first time publicly, I’ll show you the exact word-for-word script to use to use your network in an ethical, non-sleazy way — straight from my Find Your Dream Job course.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Introducing the “Closing the Loop” Technique<br></strong><br></div><div>First, if you’re curious about how to actually get the attention of VIPs, you DON’T have to do THIS:<br><br></div><div><bc-attachment content-type="image" url="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/creepy.png" width="732" height="457"><figure class="attachment attachment--preview">

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div><em>I sent this to the person he talks about in the last paragraph. She asked if I was going to meet him. I said I was afraid he was going to wear my skin as a jacket.</em></div><div>You do not have to be creepy!! For the first time, I understand what it feels like to be a woman above the age of 13.<br><br></div><div>Notice that in the second paragraph, he actually acknowledges that he should focus on ME (the busy person)…and then he does exactly the opposite!<br><br></div><div>No, no, no. If I ever find out one of you sends an email like this, I will find you, fly out to meet you (I have a lot of free time), and kill you myself. Jackasses.<br><br></div><div>You can start by focusing on simply sending a “Hey, I noticed you’re doing really interesting stuff” note. I started doing this in high school. I would be reading a magazine and see an interesting piece about somebody doing something cool. I would just send them an email saying, “Hey I read about you in Wired. That is really cool, and I’ll be following your work.” It turns out that even after being covered in national press, most people don’t get nice emails like that<em> where the person emailing doesn’t want something from them.<br></em><br></div><div>Later, in college, I would find interesting professors and email them to ask them more about their work. Usually, they would tell me to visit them at office hours, and that’s how I got lots of mentors and advisors. (One key thing you can ask in meetings with VIPs is: “Who else should I be talking to?” If you’ve impressed them, they won’t just suggest people — they’ll often introduce you themselves.)<br><br></div><div>Let’s say you’re interested in the fashion world. You want to become a designer. Where should you start?<br><br></div><div>Would you email Calvin Klein? No, a top-tier designer gets hundreds of emails a day from people wanting things from them.<br><br></div><div>Start with someone more approachable — perhaps a fashion blogger, or a freelance writer. They know the space, have connections, and can help you understand the lay of the land. Notice that this is the hard work I talked about. If it were simply as easy as emailing Calvin Klein (or whoever) to get a meeting, everyone would do it.<br><br></div><div>I’ve covered the exact <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/video-how-to-use-natural-networking-to-connect-with-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">word-for-word script</a> to connect with VIPs.<br><br></div><div>But once you’ve connected with someone you admire — whether it’s via email, phone, or best of all, a coffee meeting — what’s the secret to turning that one-time meeting into an ongoing relationship?<br><br></div><div><strong>The “secret” is following up — in the right way.<br></strong><br></div><div>See, the biggest mistake people make when networking is simply not doing it.<br><br></div><div>But the second-biggest mistake is NOT FOLLOWING UP. Do you know how many people have asked me out to coffee, taken 30 minutes of time to “pick my brain”…then I never hear from them again? I didn’t want a one-night stand! I wanted commitment!! Again I feel like a woman.<br><br></div><div>Shit, these people could take advantage of the <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/the-craigslist-penis-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Craigslist Penis Effect</a> and rise above all the unwashed masses with just one email.<br><br></div><div>What does a VIP want from someone who asks for his advice? He doesn’t need your money or introductions. He already has those.<br><br></div><div><em>A VIP wants to know that you listened to his advice and actually followed through.<br></em><br></div><div>Think about it: If I meet with someone, and they write back saying, “Hey Ramit, thanks for the time, and thanks especially for pointing out that [GENIUS POINT I MADE]. I took what you said and reached out to Beth Jones and Mike Smith and found out [AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT]. That helped me get a $3,000 raise and also get Fridays off”…<br><br></div><div>THAT is worth more than any amount of money he could give me. And it’s the first step to building a relationship.<br><br></div><div>If you’re going to meet a VIP, whether it’s over the phone, via email, or in person, why go to all that trouble…and then drop the ball by not following up?<br><br></div><div>I’ll tell you why: Because when we talk to a VIP, in the back of our heads, we have a voice whispering, “There’s no way I can help this guy. He has more money than I do…a bigger email list…he knows way more about (whatever) than I do…I should just get his advice and then not bug him again.”<br><br></div><div>This is exactly the WRONG approach to take.<br><br></div><div>And yet this is what everyone does. If you believe you’re being a nuisance to the person, <em>you will be a nuisance.</em> The truth is, busy people are desperate to mentor and help other people who are going to take action. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people will not follow up on what busy people say.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Why am I giving you this script?<br></strong><br></div><div>Even though I’ve helped thousands of students find their Dream Jobs, and I could keep my very best material in my premium courses, I wanted to give you this powerful nugget.

When you use this, you won’t come off as sleazy, slimy, or scammy — because you’re truly putting their needs ahead of your own.<br><br></div><div>Notice that a simple “thank you” message isn’t enough. Everyone sends that! It’s become the price of admission. How do you go beyond that to actually make the VIP want to help you?<br><br></div><div>Here’s how.<br><br></div><div>Enter the Closing The Loop Technique:<br><br></div><div><strong>1. Thank You (same day)<br></strong><br></div><div>Hi Steve,<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;Just wanted to thank you again for meeting with me earlier. I’m definitely going to get in touch with Susan like you recommended. I’ll keep you in the loop, and of course, please let me know if there’s anything I can do to repay the favor!<br><br></div><div>John<br><br></div><div><em>[RAMIT’S ANALYSIS: Notice the simple thank you, but also a reference to a specific action item you’re going to follow up on (showing you were paying attention during the meeting/call). This email ends with a friendly offer to help and asks nothing of the VIP.]<br></em><br></div><div><strong>2. Add Value (1-2 weeks later)<br></strong><br></div><div>Hey Steve,<br><br></div><div>Saw this article in the Wall Street Journal and it reminded me of what you said about productivity tests! No response needed, just thought you might find it interesting.<br><br></div><div>John<br><br></div><div><em>[RAMIT’S ANALYSIS: This email is where things start to get surprising. The VIP likely didn’t expect to hear back from you, since almost nobody follows up beyond one email. In this email, you’re sending a valuable piece of material — an article, blog post, photo, whatever — of something you KNOW he will find interesting.<br></em><br></div><div><em>How do you know what he’ll find interesting? Because during your meeting, you listened and took careful notes.<br></em><br></div><div><em>Finally, pay close attention to the phrase used in the last sentence: “No response needed.” This is music to a busy person’s ears. Think about it: I get 600+ emails/day, and do you know what most of them want? They want something from me. When you can say “No response needed,” and send me something I find fascinating, you’re adding value to my life.]<br></em><br></div><div><strong>3. Close the Loop (2-3 weeks later)<br></strong><br></div><div>Hi Steve,<br><br></div><div>Wanted to give you an update: I did end up talking to Susan, and you were right — Acme is definitely a fit for me. I’m reaching out to a friend there to learn all I can about Acme before I apply. If there’s anyone else you think I should speak to, please let me know.<br><br></div><div>Thanks again! I’ll let you know how it goes.<br><br></div><div>John<br><br></div><div><em>[RAMIT’S ANALYSIS: Here, you show the VIP that you actually took action on what he suggested. This will instantly differentiate you from 99% of people. Notice you name specific names, let him know if he was right (or even if you chose something different than his recommendation).<br></em><br></div><div><em>In the last 3 sentences, there are also 2 non-obvious things going on. Can you spot them?]<br></em><br></div><div>The simplicity of the Closing the Loop technique belies its effectiveness. Just like my Briefcase Technique, it seems simple and obvious — until you use it. Then its true power is revealed.<br><br></div><div>For example…<br><br></div><div>Hey Ramit,<br><br></div><div>One more testimonial to the Closing The Loop technique that you taught last night. I reached out to a prior boss I haven’t seen in 4 to 5 years about a position I heard about at that company. All I had asked for was if I could still use him as a reference and his up-to-date contact info. He responded in less than a half hour. By following up and offering to keep him in the loop, he then responded with an offer for a letter of recommendation and an offer to send a personal email to the hiring manager on my behalf. Holy Crap! It really works…<br><br></div><div>-Greg H.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>How you can use the Closing The Loop Technique<br></strong><br></div><div>You can use this today with powerful results.<br><br></div><div>If you haven’t already found someone to reach out to — someone you admire, someone you want to ask for advice from, someone you’d like to build a relationship with — <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/video-how-to-use-natural-networking-to-connect-with-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.<br><br></div><div>Once you have someone you’ve connected with once, it’s important to build the relationship by constantly adding value.<br><br></div><div>Who would you like to reconnect to? Who can YOU help and what would be most interesting and useful to them? Send them that. Put them first — not you. When you do, repeatedly showing that you’re investing in them first, you’ll separate yourself from the everyone else who (1) rarely reaches out to anyone for advice or help, and (2) only reaches out when they need something.<br><br></div><div>Stand out, and you will instantly have more credibility and higher-level connections with VIPs,<em> who will want to help you.<br></em><br></div><div>How else can you apply this? Imagine going to an informational interview at your dream company. You finally got a meeting, yet you know you’re not supposed to ask for a job. So what do you do? How do you turn this meeting where you’re asking for advice…into an invitation to apply for a job?<br><br></div><div>Enter the Closing the Loop technique.<br><br></div><div>By carefully deploying this script (tweaking it for your needs), you can turn yourself from a frustrated job-seeker, going from meeting to meeting…into a top performer who easily demonstrates why you’re different than all the other people the VIP has met with. In the end, when properly implemented, the Closing the Loop technique actually makes VIPs want to recommend, help, or even hire you. And it’s totally ethical and transparent.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>To do today<br></strong><br></div><div>Let’s get specific and go from practicing social skills to applying them to your career — and ultimately, living a rich life.<br><br></div><div>Pick ONE item to do:<br><br></div><div><strong>1. BUILD YOUR NETWORK</strong> — After today’s post, you realize the power of having a powerful group of people who want to help you. To build that network, I’m going to link you to two posts (<a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/video-how-to-use-natural-networking-to-connect-with-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/video-what-the-pros-know-about-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>) that show you how to connect with VIPs using word-for-word scripts.<br><br></div><div><strong>Your challenge</strong>: Identify 3-5 people you want to get advice from and email them, asking for the answer to a specific question (or a coffee meeting). I suggest testing your approach. Below, in the comments, post how it felt to send these emails.<br><br></div><div><strong>2. CLOSE THE LOOP</strong> — If you’ve recently met with someone, you know how important it is to add value beyond a first meeting.<br><br></div><div><strong>Your challenge</strong>: Use the CTL scripts and timing in this email to follow-up with 1-3 people.

</figure></bc-attachment></div><div>How many of us have heard career experts telling us to <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/the-worst-career-advice-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“go out there and network”</a>?<br><br></div><div>What does that actually mean? They never seem to specify.<br><br></div><div>So we end up going to 1 or 2 pointless networking events, which actually turn out to be a bunch of unemployed people looking for jobs, until we realize the pointlessness of random networking. <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-do-i-stop-being-lazy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">We stop going</a>. But we keep hearing about the importance of our network, and we hear about how most jobs are found through personal contacts. Pretty soon, it becomes clear to us that it’s WHO you know, not WHAT you know. But we have no idea how to actually turn that realization into something actionable.<br><br></div><div>There’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGY4QIIrJCc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a game going on around us</a> that we don’t even see.<br><br></div><div>And today, I want to show you exactly how to decode it — along with the specific email scripts to use. If you’ve been waiting for the real story on how networking actually works, this is it.<br><br></div><div><strong>Bonus: </strong>Simplify networking further by building it into your normal routine. That’s why I created a comprehensive guide on habit building that utilizes proven systems to set better goals and develop sustainable habits. Get your copy now.<br><br></div><div>The funny thing is, most career “experts” have no specific advice about networking because they don’t know how to do it. They give high-level advice (“add value!”) without understanding<a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-be-successful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> how people can turn that into action</a>. And here we are, the sad recipients of this useless information, wondering why others seem to get ahead, but we can’t. What if we don’t even HAVE a network?<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Look at these regrets<br></strong><br></div><div>I like to study regrets. It makes me understand what people want to do, but cannot or will not. Look at these regrets I found in my Dream Job research of 20,000+ people:<br><br></div><blockquote>”I regret not taking advantage of the multiple networking events that occur due to the type of business my company is in. I could have made a ton of networking contacts that could have facilitated career advancement.”<br>-Sean<br><br>“After ~11 years, I find myself in role largely dictated by the first position I took out of college…. I’ve looked into other positions but found a reverse grass-is-greener problem — everything else seems boring or unimportant. My skills outside of my career are varied and vibrant, always expanding, but something about the daily grind has ground me down.”<br>-Jeff<br><br>“I wish that 4 years ago when I realized I wanted to make a career change and go into psychology, I hadn’t been deterred by the application process. I could be partially through my graduate degree by now, rather than trying to figure out how I’m going to change careers, get married, and start a family. I balked because I didn’t know who to get recommendations from.”<br>-Erin<br><br>“Taking two full years to realize that being a “self-starter” wasn’t just a trait you were born with – it’s something that’s cultivated, aggressively…I took the “appropriate” career path, but sat back waiting for a job to come to me.”<br>-Nita<br><br>“I wish I would have started networking and talking to people earlier. I had always assumed that accomplishments were only worth it if you did it completely alone, but every successful person around me has a large network of people that has helped them to get there. I don’t have to do everything myself; there’s no shame in getting other people to help, especially at the stuff I’m not good at.”<br>-Andrea<br><br>“I wish I had started early when it came to networking to find a job/make contacts while I was an undergrad…. I felt a little betrayed by my schools career development office – but have realized that I am the only person that is 100% looking out for me and my career.”<br>-Matt</blockquote><div>These are extraordinarily insightful and honest.<br><br></div><div>What you’re seeing is the difference between what’s IMPORTANT and what’s URGENT. It’s always urgent to respond to that email, or to watch that TV show, or to do any of the 50 things we’re confronted with each day.<br><br></div><div>But <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-stand-out-and-get-hired/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">doing the important things</a> is more difficult. Cultivating a network, managing our finances, really discovering what we love — these are things that are more important than any email. Yet we don’t do them because we wait to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_BoV4yUsHs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“figure it out” later</a>.<br><br></div><div>That’s why we put it off for one more day, then another and another. Pretty soon, 10 years have gone by and we’re in a similar job as yesterday. Or we’ve hopped from job to job, never really knowing what you want, how to find it, and how to connect it to a Dream Job. Some of us are even making 6 figures, but still not where we want to be.<br><br></div><div>So what do we do? Usually, nothing. We claim we need to “figure it out” some day. For some of us, we get motivated like a sputtering engine — sending out 20 or 30 resumes in a month — but when we don’t hear back, we settle back down, resigned to our place in life.<br><br></div><div>Not cool. Not cool at all.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>We can do more than regret<br></strong><br></div><div>I wanted to show you that you can actually take the stuff you “know” you should do — managing your money, earning more, negotiating your salary, finding your passion, and even finding your Dream Job — and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQjFdPDJ75Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">do it today</a>.<br><br></div><div>Most of the time, you don’t have to wait until some mythical day when you have enough experience.<br><br></div><div>But I wasn’t sure people would actually care. See, people “claim” they want to find a mentor — and I actually thought about developing a course on how to find amazing mentors — but nobody wants to pay for something like that. They “claim” they want to lose weight…but adherence rates to lifestyle changes are incredibly difficult. It turns out that changing our behavior is really hard — even when we genuinely want something.<br><br></div><div>But I don’t give a damn. I knew some people would find massive value in it. The rest would skim along, nodding and saying, “Yeah, I should really do that…” while others would be soaring ahead. And that’s fine — I’d rather work with the small group of people who take action than a massive group of unwashed masses who want tactic after tactic.<br><br></div><div>So let me show you the ins and outs of networking. This is material you’ve never seen anywhere else before.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>How networking REALLY works<br></strong><br></div><div>I mentioned before that I’ve been testing my Dream Job material for years. What I didn’t mention is that I’ve been testing it in ways most people don’t realize.<br><br></div><div>Here’s a segment on negotiation I did on ABC, where I tested a small tweak in negotiation advice I’d discovered. I waited for results from viewers, as well as sending this to a few of my readers to try out.<br><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote>“I was a fresh college graduate making around $32k a year. After doing a bit of studying and really putting what I learned into action, I’m now making six figures (a year and a half later). I’m revealing this because I think literally anyone can do this if they just get up and take action. It’s really cliche, but that’s what it all comes down to.<br>-Eric S.<br><br>“Taking a testing approach to a project or goal can move me much more quickly to action. By choosing to take INCREMENTAL steps, the stakes don’t feel so high for a given activity. Fear of failure is reduced and it becomes much easier to stay motivated for taking action.”<br>-Logan Y., Dream Job Elite graduate</blockquote><div><a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/losers-love-tactics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Testing</a> applies to networking, as well.<br><br></div><div>Most people think networking is about being sleazy, slimy, and scammy. They imagine the slick-haired business guy flitting around a room, handing out business cards, then winking and saying “Catch ya later!” Wrong, wrong, wrong. This is a false dichotomy people concoct to avoid learning how networking really works. It’s easier to be disgusted by networking than to learn how to do it right — a classic pre-emptive defense mechanism.<br><br></div><div>Unfortunately, the dissmisive pleasure is short-lived. While you say “Networking is sleazy,” other people are getting ahead — ethically and rapidly.<br><br></div><div>I call this “Natural Networking,” because it truly is natural. In fact, many of the journalists and CEOs I know will read this. They won’t be alarmed or skeeved out. THAT is how comfortable I am revealing these methods — because not only are they effective, but I can share them publicly.<br><br></div><div>The first thing you’ll notice is that it’s far more powerful to spend a week trying to meet with one person than a week trying to go to random networking events. In this case, “less is more” is true — it’s far more effective to focus and meet interesting, relevant people than to blindly throw your business cards into the wind. I don’t even think I have business cards any more.<br><br></div><div>Top performers build their network BEFORE they need it. That’s how they can get laid off on a Monday and have a better job lined up by Friday. Read that sentence again, please — it means that top performers are comfortable meeting people and cultivating relationships with no specific purpose. In fact, it’s almost always to help the other person!<br><br></div><div>Now, the Dream Job course covers networking in depth, including the specific words to use in emails and even in coffee-shop conversations. Today, I want to show you how to get started. And I intend for this free material to rival any paid material on networking, anywhere.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>The first step to networking<br></strong><br></div><div>We’ve all heard about “informational interviews” but few of us do it. What is it? How does it work? And how can you use subtle techniques to make an informational interview help you — and more importantly, the other person — even if you have seemingly little to offer?<br><br></div><div>First, an informational interview is an opportunity to meet someone you’re curious about and learn from them. Maybe you’re curious what a Product Manager really does. Maybe you want to know what the culture at IDEO is like. That’s what an informational interview allows you to do.<br><br></div><div>Second, THIS IS NOT WEIRD. What’s weird is a bunch of whiny 20- and 30-somethings doing the same damned mindless resume submitting, then wondering why they don’t have jobs. Are you seriously kidding me? Informational interviews are one of the most powerful techniques in your Dream Job arsenal, yet because they seem “weird,” people don’t do them. You continue thinking they’re weird while I sail around in a flying car paid for by my Dream Job, which I got because I used effective informational interviews. I hate you.<br><br></div><div>Next, people WANT to meet with smart people. That means you, if you send a great email, have incisive questions, and are interesting. People do not want to meet with idiots, which includes people who…<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Ask worthless questions</strong> (“Dear Ramit, what should I do with my money?” Uh….read the last 8 years of my site?)</li><li><strong>Ramble</strong> (“Hi I’m blah blah and I’m really interested in blah blah and once when I was a kid we went to the park and blah blah and…well I guess this got really long, so…yeah. Thanks for reading.” SUICIDE IS PERMITTED FOR YOU)</li><li><strong>Only talk about themselves</strong> (Hi Mr. Senior Exec at a Fortune 100 company, let me tell you about my background, what I studied in school, what I’m interested in….” You are there to LEARN FROM THE IMPORTANT PERSON. NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOU AND YOUR STUPID INTERESTS).</li></ul><div>Ok, so let’s talk about what makes a great informational interview.<br><br></div><div>Here are the people who have reached out to me, stood out, met with me, and I’ve helped them find jobs (or even hired them myself). By the way, I’m not that important, but I’m just using myself as an example of someone who gets a lot of emails/day (600+) so it’s challenging to reach me.<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>They reached out through a warm contact.</strong> If they didn’t have one, they spent the time to find one by studying who I know. (The info is out there, you lazy asses. Facebook, Twitter, 8 million pages I’ve written, the “Acknowledgements” page of my book. And this isn’t just about me, it’s about any busy person you want to meet.)</li><li><strong>They explained any similarities we had.</strong> An alum reaches out to me who seems genuine? I’ll almost always take a phone call or, if convenient, a coffee meeting. Maybe they grew up in my hometown, or went to my high school. Even I have a small semblance of emotion, leading me to occasionally act like a normal human being.</li><li><strong>They reached out with a BRIEF, CONCISE EMAIL.</strong> I will show you the exact words to use in my Dream Job course so you don’t instantly eliminate yourself.</li><li><strong>They met with me and asked very insightful questions.</strong> GOOD: I noticed you did XYZ. It’s interesting because Very-Important-Person took a different approach and did ABC. What was your thinking? BAD: I’m so unhappy at my job. What should I do with my life? Ugh. Get a bowl of soup and a therapist. That’s not the kind of question you ask at an informational interview.</li><li><strong>They asked questions for 90% of the informational interview,</strong> interjecting insightful comments once in a while, showing that they’d done their homework. In the last 10%, they mentioned what they were working on and asked for advice. When they were especially impressive/likeable, I offered to introduce them to people I know, or outright offered to hire them.</li><li><strong>They never outright asked for a job,</strong> which you never, ever do in an informational interview. They also gave me an “out” in case I couldn’t/didn’t want to help them.</li><li><strong>NOTE: These were not all the most socially smooth people.</strong> Some of them were downright socially awkward. Doesn’t matter! Sometimes, awkward can be endearing! Not everyone is Rico Suave. But the very best showed a remarkable level of preparation, which anyone can do — but few actually do.</li></ul><div>As a result, many of these people stood out among tens of thousands of others who left comments/emails/tweets. Not only do the very best top performers have an uncanny ability to reach extremely busy people, but they can turn a one-time meeting into a long-term relationship. And over time, that is worth more than almost any technical skill or amount of experience.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Use these email scripts to meet anyone<br></strong><br></div><div>Follow these steps:<br><br></div><ol><li>Brainstorm list of 10 people you’d like to could connect with. Start with these people: People who have a job title you’re interested in learning more about. People who work at companies you’re interested in potentially working at. And people who are doing interesting things you want to learn more about (e.g., you read about them in a magazine/blog post).</li><li>Get their email address. If you can’t find this you fail at life. But you read this site so I suspect you’re cool.</li><li>Use these scripts — from an upcoming course I’m launching.</li></ol><div><strong>How to set up an informational interview<br></strong><br></div><div>An informational interview is an opportunity to meet someone who works in a position or industry you’d like to work in, where you can ask them questions about their job and get the inside scoop.<br><br></div><div>Never, ever directly ask for a job in an informational interview. That’s a big no-no. You <em>can</em> turn an informational interview into a potential job opportunity, but only if you approach it wisely. Here’s the first step of that process: The email introduction for an informational interview.<br><br></div><div>By the way, the best place to get informational interviews is via your alumni association. People who went to the same college have a bond with each other, even decades later.<br><br></div><blockquote>To: Jane<br>From: Samantha<br>Subject: Michigan State grad — would love to chat about your work at Deloitte<br><br>Hi Jane,<br><br>My name is Samantha Kerritt. I’m a ’04 grad from Michigan State (I know you were a few years before me) and I came across your name on our alumni site. [TELL THEM HOW YOU CAME ACROSS THEIR NAME SO YOU DON’T SEEM LIKE A CREEP]<br><br>I’d love to get your career advice for 15-20 minutes. I’m currently working at Acme Tech Company, but many of my friends work in consulting and each time they tell me how much they love their job, I get more interested. [THE FIRST SENTENCE SAYS WHAT SHE WANTS. MOST PEOPLE ARE FLATTERED THAT PEOPLE WANT/VALUE THEIR ADVICE.<br><br>Most of them have told me that if I’m interested in consulting, I have to talk to someone at Deloitte. Do you think I could pick your brain on your job and what motivated you to choose Deloitte? I’d especially love to know how you made your choices after graduating from Michigan State. [THE PHRASE “PICK YOUR BRAIN” IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ASK FOR ADVICE AND FLATTER, AND “MICHIGAN STATE” REINFORCES SHARED BOND]<br><br>I can meet you for coffee or at your office…or wherever it’s convenient. I can work around you! [THE BUSY PERSON IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU. TREAT THEM ACCORDINGLY.]<br><br>Would it be possible for us to meet? [A BUSY PERSON CAN SIMPLY REPLY TO THIS WITH A “YES” — PERFECT. NOTE THAT I DIDN’T ASK FOR THE TIME/LOCATION AS THAT’S TOO MUCH INFORMATION IN THE FIRST EMAIL.]<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>-Samantha</blockquote><div><strong>How to ask for recommendations for people to talk to<br></strong><br></div><blockquote>Hello John,<br><br>Hope all is well.<br><br>If you recall, we spoke a few months ago when I was exploring new career opportunities in information security (I was your student at the time). Thanks again for agreeing to be my reference! [REMIND THE BUSY PERSON HOW YOU KNOW EACH OTHER<br><br>I was browsing the the Acme Career site the other day and the Research Scientist role caught my eye. I think it’d be perfect for me considering my work on insider threat-related projects at Current Company. [NOTE THAT THE FOCUS OF THIS EMAIL IS ASKING FOR RECOMMENDATIONS, NOT DIRECTLY ASKING FOR A JOB. JOHN UNDERSTANDS YOU’RE LOOKING FOR WORK AND DOESN’T WANT TO BE PUT ON THE SPOT. IF HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE POSITION, HE WILL.]<br><br>From what I remember, it sounds pretty similar to the work you do at Acme. By any chance, do you know of anyone there that you think I should chat with? I’d love to learn more about the role so I can see if it’s the right fit for me.<br><br>If not, no problem — just wanted to keep you in the loop. Thanks again for all your help!<br><br>Take care,<br>Roger</blockquote><div>You now have both the tactics (the email scripts) as well as a strategic approach (narrowing down your networking, focusing on helping others, and understanding the power dynamic).<br><br></div><div>All in one day.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>The powerful results of Natural Networking<br></strong><br></div><div>Don’t just listen to me. Look at these student results:<br><br></div><blockquote>I was about to close the loop with some of my [contacts] when they both contacted me. It appears I have allies willing to help me out… it’s crazy how rapidly this stuff changes.<br>– Chris C., Dream Job Elite graduate<br><br>“I used to think I was really good at networking, but this module showed me what a novice I was. It took natural networking to a whole different (and higher) level. I always got stuck with what to do after I sent the thank you notes from my coffee meetings. Now I know how to follow up with the closing the loop technique. This would have taken me YEARS to figure out, if at all.”<br>– Annie L., Dream Job Elite graduate</blockquote><div>This is just the tip of the iceberg.<br><br></div><div>I have over 10+ hours of detail on Natural Networking in the upcoming course, including more email scripts and a powerful tactic that has resulted in invitations to international conferences, TV appearances, and job offers. (I’ll be sharing more of this with the people on my free Dream Job Insider’s list. <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/c/find-your-dream-job/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Click here</a> to join.)<br><br></div><div><strong><br>To Do Today<br></strong><br></div><div>What will you do with this? Will you nod and shrug and say, “Yeah, I should really do this…”<br><br></div><div>Or will you identify 10 people, emailing all of them, knowing that 2-3 will get back to you and agree to talk?<br><br></div><div>This isn’t URGENT. But it is important. And a year from now, you can be in the same place…or you can have built relationships with superb people, helping them, and knowing that they want to help you, too.<br><br></div><div>I want you to take action today. I want you to know that networking is not about being sleazy, slimy, or scammy. It’s about helping others and doing more preparation than anyone else so they want to help you.<br><br></div><div><strong>Do this:<br></strong><br></div><div>Brainstorm 10 people you want to or should meet. Get their email addresses. Use the scripts above. Schedule and take the coffee meetings. Use second script to ask for referrals for other informational interviews.<br><br></div><div>I gave you one pitch in this post: “Can I pick your brain?” I cover more in the Dream Job course. But today I want to challenge you to come up with great pitches yourself. Leave a comment with your best one below.</div>
