But, like most people, you may still be unclear or even hesitant about what it really means. This workshop will help you zero in on the essential elements of reaching out, connecting with others and networking to get the results you want. <br><br>Besides being the founder of VFN Professionals, <strong>Elizabeth C. Miller</strong> is a conversation advocate and empowers professionals to use English more confidently and expand opportunities for work, networking &amp; more. With her guidance, her clients have been able to get unstuck and dramatically improve their English skills and reach their goals. Today, she is ready to help you unlock doors and expand your reach – this could mean:<br><br></div><ul><li>taking your networking to the next level</li><li>increasing your salary</li><li>opening new business markets</li><li>securing a new job</li><li>passing an important exam</li><li>developing new business opportunities</li><li>&amp; more!</li></ul><div><strong><br><br>Thank you<br>Welcome<br></strong><br>At talkwithecm - I work with high level professionals to Get unstuck, overcome fears &amp; speak confidently in English to reach professional goals and make their dreams a reality. <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>The 3 Things You Need To Know To Introduce Yourself WITHOUT Feeling Awkward<br><br></strong><br>This is my first VFN workshop, and I’m very excited to get started. I know that what I’m presenting for you today have a great value and I’ve chosen a specific way to deliver it to you. Some of the things are new, and I’d love to know how it meets your needs. Any feedback is welcome. <br><br><strong>What to expect </strong>in the next 1.5 hours / how this will work &amp; instructions how you can get the most out of our time together <br>1 - input - some solo work &amp; writing<br>2 - workshop - get up / physically moving around / talking / acting putting this into practice - <br>3 - big reflection &amp; look at next steps<br><br>Any questions so far?<br><br><br><strong>CANVA - slide #2</strong><br><strong>Sildo - </strong><br>Today we will be using Slido to collect questions and allow you to interact using live polls. This is a tool we want to try out - and I want to tell you upfront:<br>-you can remain 100% anonymous<br>-you are not required to submit your name<br>-nothing is tracked<br>-nothing is stored long term<br>You can now take out your smart phones, go to slido.com and type in our event code #VFN<br><br>the first thing it will ask is your name - write ANY name, you will still have the option to be anon later.<br><br><strong><br></strong>+slido instructions - Q&amp;A always open - polls changes.<br><br><strong>open slido</strong><br>Let's get started with our first question:<br><br><strong>SCREEN -</strong> first question:<br>Are you in? #7<br><br>You should see this on your phone &amp; the sceen<br>You may select and send your answer at any time...but only I will see your answer.&nbsp; If you change your mind, that's fine select another answer &amp; send again. but you can only send ONE answer<br><br>Question #2</div><ul><li>read through &amp; select &amp; submit one answer</li></ul><div><br><br><br>Unlike others - this is not a sit down, uh-huh lecture...where you feel inspired / excited about change, but leave &amp; nothing actually changes...sure you remember to try out one or the other tip, but after a few months,&nbsp; life happens &amp; you're back to the same old.<br>Ok, final answers? I will now close the polling &amp; we can take a look at all of the answers. <br>show answers - discuss<br><br><br><strong>Slido</strong><br>+ Are you with me - ready to get started? And start taking those first steps to getting what you actually want.&nbsp;</div><div><br>show answers - discuss<br>&nbsp;<strong>stop quiz<br></strong><br><strong>CANVA- next slide</strong><br>Today we are going to take a look at the uncomfortable stuff. When you are at a networking event, meeting someone new, at a job interview, meeting the parents - Where do you feel uncomfortable? What does that feel like? Maybe you get a bit sweaty, stomach is turning or you are ready to walk out the door? Think about that &amp; what does it feel like for YOU.<br><br>Here is a list of words that many of my clients use / find helpful.<br><br>give <strong>Worksheet #1</strong><br>fear / anxiety / shame / shy / panic / frustrated&nbsp; / nervous / stupid / embarrassed / awkward / <br><br>negative thoughts / mind goes blank / forget my words/ want to flee / want to run / want to hide / too quiet / too loud / too&nbsp; boastful / too technical / geeky / <br><br>sweaty / shaking / stomach turning / cold sweat / dry mouth /can't breathe / pounding heart / heavy breathing / headaches / <br><br>write a single word or phrase to describe that feeling - keep that in your mind and I want to collect all of that here:<br><br><strong>change screen to slido<br>Feelings Word Cloud - type in a single word or phrase that describe that feeling &amp; click at the bottom 'send/vote" to add your response. <br>Do you have a few words / feelings, add them one at a time, selecting 'vote/submit' or 'add response' each time.</strong><br><br> <strong>turn on word cloud<br></strong><br>WOW ! Right<br>Throughout tonight, I'd like you to pay attention to your feelings and imagine how you might feel 'out in the real world' - what does that feel like? what's happening? I want to use today and work through that - this is a hands on workshop.&nbsp; When you notice this - even just a little bit - I want to know about it. You can raise your hand, come over and talk to me during a break, add more words to our slido word cloud.<br><br>So, you know what you want - bucket<br>&amp; you've told me what gets in your way - feelings<br><br>CANVA SLIDE<br>Now let's talk about:<br><strong>The 3 Things You Need To Know To Introduce Yourself WITHOUT Feeling Awkward</strong><br><br><strong>turn off feeling cloud</strong> - but we will come back to that later - so whenever you notice some feelings - make a note (on worksheet #1 - paper) to enter later. <br><br><br><strong>1. be approachable- </strong>&nbsp;sounds good, what does that mean actually? <br>Now, I can talk about what to wear, how to stand, where to look...but if you memorise&nbsp; - robot - NOT authentic<br>let's take a look at what OTHERS are doing...<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>canva slide<br></strong>open slido poll question - <strong>who would you approach? <br><br></strong>Ok, I see answers coming in...good, but I'm not going to show them on the screen. You can watch on your smart phone if you wish.<br><br>click through slido and discuss<strong><br></strong>APPROACH-CLOTHES-POSTURE<strong> </strong>photo a,b,c, d (phone, closed, somewhat open / colorful jacket, open / the face??)<br>this starts before you even leave your house - what to wear, mental preparation.<br><br><strong>NEXT SLIDE </strong><br>APPROACH-GROUP - who would you approach?<br>a,b,c,d<br><br>click through slido &amp; discuss<br>how to be open - posture, phone, distance<br><br><strong>NEXT SLIDE </strong><br><strong>2. start simple</strong><br>- <strong>what's the best way to start a conversation?</strong> with your name / handshake, eye contact, joke, smile, the reason you want to talk to the person<br>Click through slido &amp; discuss<br><br>- Hi, I’m Emma, I help busy women like you eat healthier to lose weight, get more energy, and thrive in their body and life." - (blank stare) Ok..uh...I'm Elizabeth.&nbsp;<br><br>- Hi, how are you?<br> - Hi, I'm Elizabeth...and you are?&nbsp;<br><br>But don't stop there -&nbsp;<br><br>easy conversation starters,&nbsp;<br><br>-What's your story?&nbsp;</div><div><br>-How / Why questions - These are often referred to as open-ended questions, which simply means that you can’t give a short one word answer. They are perfect for getting a conversation started.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>-An added bonus of having a few great questions prepared in advance is that when you ask interesting questions &amp; people think YOU are interesting, but the converse is true as well, when you ask boring or limited questions...right - you come across as boring as well.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>-Tell me more about that! (magic words!) Great for building on topics in common.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>*************<br><br><strong>3. pay attention to body language<br>slide - open poll</strong><br>who looks more engaged? <strong>who's listening?</strong> photo 1,2,3,4,5&nbsp;<br>What are some things you can do to non-verbally say "I'm listening"<br>click through poll<br>-turn your whole body towards the person you are speaking with - toes / legs / core / face / eyes&nbsp;<br><br>-Hold eye contact with someone one second longer than you normally would.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>-React to meeting someone or hearing something interesting with subtle changes in your body language.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>--a growing smile&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>--lifting eyebrows (lightning fast!) - WOW! That’s great.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>--a slight nod / head tilt (This must be SUPER SUBTLE!! Otherwise you risk looking like one of those bobble head dolls)&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>-Get closer (SLIGHT lean in - SUBTLE otherwise creepy / sexual intentions)<br><br>slide<br><br></div><div>- SMILE??&nbsp;<br>No, there is no need to smile ever. I do, however, suggest keeping a relaxed mouth and jaw. A genuine smile can really work in your favor.&nbsp;<br><br>A smile is the shortest distance between two people."&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>- Victor Borge&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br><strong>slido - revisit that Feelings Cloud - FEELINGS CLOUD IS NOW OPEN &amp; will remain open until the end of this workshop!</strong><br><br>Now that you have a clearer idea about how to set yourself up for a great introduction, now it is time to put all of this into practice. <br>But first I want to say a few words about how to talk about yourself. Or more specifically, how to answer that dreaded question, <strong>"So, tell me, what do you do?" <br><br></strong><br>simple 4 part recipe to talk about YOU without feeling awkward:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong><br>My Super Savvy Introduction&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><br><strong>My Super Savvy Introduction&nbsp;<br>I - solo work - WORKSHEET</strong></div><div><br>1) I'm a _______________ (what you do /job title or general description)<br>work with some ideas here - deli-lama!<br><br></div><ol><li>Master of Disaster - helps federal, state, and local authorities access the information they need to recover quickly from calamities - MapInfo Corp.</li><li>President and TeaEO - play on words here for the CEO - Honest Tea</li></ol><div>special note - in between jobs / career shift! No problem<br><br>Career Change?&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>In the past, I worked as a </strong>(what you did / job title or general description). <strong>But recently, I made a big shift.<br>&nbsp;Now I'm </strong>(what you do / job title or general description) <br><br><strong><br>I'm between jobs right now, but I'm really passionate about&nbsp;<br></strong><br></div><div><br>(desired job title or general description)&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br><br></div><div><br><br>2) and I work with____________________________(who you support /boss, customers)&nbsp;<br>this may seem like a simple question, but take some time to consider ALL of the people that you interact with and how you support them / make their lives better<br><br><br>3) helping them_________________________________(the big picture of what you do)&nbsp;<br><br>4) so that they can __________________________(the results you make possible)&nbsp;<br>this is extremely important - not only do you want to tell what you do, but this makes it crystal clear to your listener WHY your work is important.&nbsp;<br>ok - I help people lose weight...meh,&nbsp;<br>better - I help people finally lose the weight they've been carrying around for years so that they can look and feel their best! - do you hear the difference? look and feel their best - I want that! Who doesn't want that? Right?</div><div><br>GOAL: Try to keep it authentic and conversational – get rid of anything too salesy or that just doesn’t feel like you. <br><br><strong><br>II - pair work A - 3-5 minutes<br>pair</strong>WORK&nbsp; - <br>1. Get together, read off you answers. <br>How does it FEEL to say them?<br>How does it sound to the other person? <br>2.

WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED - SHOW ME -sitting down, facing front, quiet<br><br><strong>III - Group input</strong><br>So, how did that go? THUMBS<br>Questions? Trouble shooting.<br><br>What next?<br>☐ Keep it brief! (10-15 seconds!) This is not the time to describe everything that you do.&nbsp;<br>-clear and confident<br>-peak the interest of others<br>-easier to remember!<br><br>Next work session has two parts:<br>1. Time yourself:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>MY TIME: ___________&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>☐ What's next? Get unstuck! Just because someone asks about what you do does not mean that you must stick to this topic, unless this is exactly what you want. With a Super Savvy Introduction YOU are in control and can easily plan and direct the conversation exactly where you want to go: <br>+dig deeper - "Is this something that you have experience with?" <br>+learn more about the other person - "And what about you?" <br>+branch off into a new topic - "So, tell me about that conference in Berlin." <br><br>goal - be authentic! not phoney <br><br><strong>IV - pairwork B - 3 minutes!<br>WORKSHEET<br>drafts / time / unstuck</strong><br><br></div><div><strong>V - team work C - 3-4 people (4 min + 2 min)<br></strong>practice directing the conversation where you want to go in a group setting...&amp; at the end - THE LAST 2 MINUTES give feedback<br>what worked, what stood out, what were your impressions of other, how did it feel?<br><br><strong>VI - gather <br>feelings / </strong>questions / troubleshooting<br>What happened?<br>What worked - what needs improvement<br><br><strong>VII -Closing - Group reflection<br></strong><br><strong>closing the feelings cloud</strong><br>+ big takeaways<br><br>So from what we have covered so far, what is your #1 takeaway?
