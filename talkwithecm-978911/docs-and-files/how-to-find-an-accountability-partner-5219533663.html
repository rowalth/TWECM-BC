      How to find an accountability partner
      
    </h1>
  </header>

    <div class="formatted_content">
      <div>I like to think of an accountability partner as someone who is on my side and cheering for me to succeed. This person wants to help me stay focused on what really matters and not paralysed by indecision or fears.&nbsp; This is someone who wants to help me have the life I really want and is willing to put in the time (and effort) to make it happen. This also means, of course, I am also ready to the same in return.<br><br>Curious<br><br>Joining forces with another person, pulling on the same rope and helping each other is exciting, but of course, it's hard. You struggle with the same things. You have the same doubts. You may even think to quit. But, and here's the magic, you'll be facing all those challenges together. This is exactly what makes having an accountability partner so powerful!</div><div><br>Your accountability partner is there to help you, and you're there to help them. When you succeed - you'll be there celebrating your accomplishments, together. <br><br><br>- <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="autolinked" data-behavior="truncate" href="http://www.tasktwins.com/how-to-find-good-accountability-partner/">http://www.tasktwins.com/how-to-find-good-accountability-partner/</a><br>- forget mentors <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="autolinked" data-behavior="truncate" href="https://www.quietrev.com/forget-mentors-find-an-accountability-partner/">https://www.quietrev.com/forget-mentors-find-an-accountability-partner/</a><br>- <strong>There are two critical things to know about accountability and accountability partners:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li><strong>Accountability must involve consequences.</strong> For example, you’re accountable to reach your gate 15 minutes before departure because <em>the airline will close the door.</em> If there are no consequences, there is no accountability. Being “held accountable” just means that the consequence is enforced. This is the big kahuna.</li><li><strong>An accountability partner is someone who enforces consequences. </strong>Often, the consequences are expressed via the relationship itself, e.g. you damage a valuable relationship by not showing up, or you risk losing your membership in a group. If you want to keep enjoying the benefits of a diligent study buddy, or a running companion who always makes great conversation, you’ll show up so that you can keep the relationship.</li></ul><div><strong>What should you look for in an accountability partner?<br></strong><br></div><ul><li><em>Availability</em>. Are they available at the times you need them to be? If it’s a group, do the options, timing or flexibility work for your schedule?</li><li><em>Alignment</em>. Do you share alignment on goals and objectives? Do you feel like you’re heading in the same direction, even if you’re not always in the same place?</li><li><em>Reliability</em>. Do they dependably show up and fulfill their side of the agreement?</li><li><em>Positivity</em>. Are they encouraging? Do they believe in the future you want to create? Do they validate your goals, and your ability to achieve them? At a bare minimum, do they refrain from negativity and putting you down?</li><li><em>Important to you.</em> Do you value the relationship, or your membership in the group? Is keeping that relationship or membership motivating enough to keep you accountable?</li><li><em>Willing and able to enforce consequences.</em> Are there clear consequences? Are they easily (or implicitly) enforceable? For groups, are there mechanisms in place to exact consequences, whether social or financial?</li></ul><div>This is generally a case where quality matters a lot more than quantity. (For some goals, one solid accountability partner is all you need.)</div>
