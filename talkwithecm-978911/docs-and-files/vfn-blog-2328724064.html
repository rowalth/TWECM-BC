      <div><strong>Revealed: 3 Steps To Rock Your Next Event </strong><strong><em>WITHOUT</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;Feeling Awkward Or Shy</strong></div><div><br>"Ugg! I wish that I had talked to you about this last week!" my friend moaned. We were catching up at a local coffee shop and she was feeling really frustrated. She had had the opportunity to represent her company to a high profile client, and not just any client, but her dream employer - the exact company where she would <em>love </em>to work.&nbsp;<br><br>"Awesome!" I cheered, but she didn't look happy about it at all.&nbsp;<br><br>"No - it was awful." She felt stuck.&nbsp;<br><br>She wasn't sure how to show that she was interested in joining their team without seeming too opportunistic or disloyal to her current job. So, in the end, she said nothing at all!<br><br>"It's like I was given the golden opportunity - a real chance to get my dream job! - and I just threw it away...ugg! But after our talk today, I know exactly what to say and do at the next meeting!"<br><br><br>Whether you are looking for a job, want to grow your business or are looking to push your career to the next level, you know that networking is vital for your career. But, like my friend, you may still be unclear or even hesitant about what it really means to network. If you meet someone tonight, next week or next month, use this quick guide to zero in on the essential elements of networking so you'll know exactly what to do to get the results you want.&nbsp;<br><br>Most people know that networking is important, but very few people actually know what is involved, what to do, or how to actually enjoy the process! When working with people to help them prepare for an event, client meeting or job interview, I hear a lot of different concerns:<br><br></div><ul><li>How should I dress?&nbsp;</li><li>What should I say?&nbsp;</li><li>I hate small talk!</li><li>Is it even worth it?</li></ul><div><strong><br>The truth is that networking is about making personal connections and creating relationships, not just getting a job or closing a sale. </strong>And no matter how advanced technology may be, face to face communications and personal connections still carry more weight and open more doors than emails and texts. Plus, meeting face to face, even for a short amount of time helps give you insight about others. Networking events can be a super efficient way to meet a large number of like minded people in a short amount of time.<br><br><br>With just a bit of prework, you can come home from your next event with something much more valuable than a pile of random business cards and memories of cheese cubes. Read these tips so you’ll know exactly what to do before, during and after your next opportunity to connect authentically with others and build up your power network. <br><br><strong><br><br>Before:<br></strong><br></div><ol><li><strong>Dress the part.</strong> Appearances count, so make sure that you look good and feel comfortable. Did you know that first impressions are already being formed before you even say a single word? If you’re not sure what to wear, check the website and promotional materials to get an idea of what’s appropriate.</li><li><strong>Rehearse.</strong> Take the time to practice introducing yourself, your 30 second pitch and some relevant small talk. You need to be prepared to speak and present yourself in a confident and interesting way. It also helps to have a few subjects already preloaded in your pocket that you can discuss to create connections and build rapport.</li><li><strong>Volunteer &amp; get involved. </strong>Helping out at events can be a great way to reduce your expenses and be more engaged even if you tend to feel shy. Contact the organizers to find out about volunteer opportunities or other ways to get involved.&nbsp;</li></ol><div><br></div><blockquote>Because I tend to be shy, I always try to volunteer for the sign-in desk. That way I can be the first smile people see when they arrive and, because we've already talked, I find it so much easier to start a conversation later.<br><br><em>- JANETTE K.&nbsp;</em></blockquote><div><br><strong><br><br>During:<br></strong><br></div><ol><li><strong>Give value.</strong> Effective networking is actually based on being generous. Potential contacts are more likely to welcome your interest if they have the feeling that you’re more focused on what you can do for them rather than coming off as an opportunist who is only looking out for yourself and what you can gain from the situation.</li><li><strong>Make introductions.</strong> If you already know some of the attendees, think about who they might like to meet. Acting as a hub and providing introductions strengthens your network and helps others feel more comfortable as well. You can even introduce people you just met to help keep conversations flowing.</li><li><strong>Refine your story.</strong> Networking events are a great time to focus on building relationships rather than selling or promoting yourself. Use this opportunity to practice and test out your pitch in different ways. By not focusing on a sale, you can test out different introductions, conversation topics or even your elevator pitch with much less at stake. You’ll also have a wide audience to work with.</li></ol><blockquote>Taking the time to prepare your introduction in advance helps keep you in control to steer conversations in the direction you want so that you get more quality connections, deeper conversations, and more added value.<br><br><em>- Elizabeth C. Miller</em></blockquote><div><br><strong><br>After:<br></strong><br></div><ol><li><strong>See it through. </strong>End Strong. Any event can be productive, but it is up to you to take strategic action with the contacts that you have just made. That might mean sharing a contact, sending an article or setting up a coffee meeting.</li><li><strong>Act quickly.</strong> Reach out as soon as possible so your last conversation will be fresh in their mind. You’ll make a positive impression and their interest may still be high.</li><li><strong>Review &amp; reflect.</strong> Think of developing your networking skills as an ongoing project, rather than a once and done thing. After each event, reflect on what went well and what you want to try differently next time.</li></ol><div><br>Going to events and trying to network may seem like a lot of effort, but when you are warmed up and ready to go, the opportunities and potential for growth are absolutely worth it. Connecting with others is essential to build your power network, advance your career, and grow your business.<br><br><br>Now that you have a clearer idea about how to set yourself up and ROCK your next event, I want give you. more support and help you get crystal clear about how to introduce yourself. I created a FREE guide that goes into detail about presenting your value front and center <em>without </em>coming across as salesy, boastful or over-the-top technical. Or more specifically, how to answer that often dreaded question, <strong>"So, tell me, what do you do?"</strong> in a way that attracts interest and makes people curious to learn more.&nbsp; I’ve created a powerful, yet simple, 4 part recipe you can use to introduce yourself authentically - My Super Savvy Introduction.<br><br><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(5, 98, 185);">Click here to get your copy of the FREE guide "HOW TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF WITHOUT FEELING AWKWARD"</span></div><div><br></div><div></div>
